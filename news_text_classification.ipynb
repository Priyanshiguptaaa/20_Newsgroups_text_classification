This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1.

The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn\\'t able\\n    to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.

       " 'From: vek@allegra.att.com (Van Kelly)\\nSubject: Re: Prayer in Jesus\\' Name\\nOrganization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA\\nLines: 39\\n\\nAccording to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking \"in X\\'s\\nname\" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today\\nwould call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus\\' culture authorized\\nto conduct business \"in John\\'s name\" had full authority over John\\'s\\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\\nwork only for John\\'s benefit and consonant with John\\'s wishes.  It was\\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\\n\"in John\\'s name\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\\nand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal\\nand religious definitions of \"faith\".)\\n\\nWith this cultural background, praying \"in Jesus\\' name\" does not\\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\\n\"fiduciary\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His\\nKingdom.  The message of \"praying in Jesus\\' name\" is thus closely\\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God\\'s\\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying \"in Jesus\\' name\" is not only\\npresent but prominent in the Lord\\'s Prayer, although the verbal\\nforumula is absent.\\n\\nThe act of praying the words \"In Jesus\\' Name\" may be beneficial if\\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\\nadvancement of God\\'s Kingdom.  For that reason, I\\'m not quite ready\\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\\n\\nPrayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\\netc.) don\\'t seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\\nChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that\\'s B.C.E. or\\nC.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don\\'t see anything in Christ\\'s words to\\ncontradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His\\nomniscience and grace.\\n\\nVan Kelly\\nvek@research.att.com\\n\\n\\nThe above opinions are my own, and not those of AT&T.\\n',\n",

If you\\'re feeling\\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn\\'t been taken already, you can\\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\\nthat you won\\'t get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\\n\\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You\\'ll\\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\\nnet, and you\\'ll look like a clueless newbie too.\\n\\nBy now you\\'re probably asking \"So who\\'s the KotL already?\". Well, as\\nJohn Sloan notes below, that\\'s about the only real \"secret\" left around\\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\\nKotL\\'s first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie\\nmailers\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\\nDead-Head.\\n\\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\\n\\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL\\'s employers, sending yet\\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\\n\\n***********************************************************************\\n\\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren\\'t what\\nthey used to be.

They discuss motorcycles and  \\nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \\nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \\ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \\nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \\nargue with each other and plan rides together.\\n\\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \\nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \\nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \\nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\\n\\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \\nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \\nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \\nrec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it\\'s the file name for \\nthe group\\'s primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per \\nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \\nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \\nto as the DoD.\\n\\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \\nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \\nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen \\nof Doom.\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \\nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \\ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\\n\\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \\nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \\nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \\nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \\nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \\nGermany, Norway and Finland.\\n\\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \\nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \\nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \\nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \\nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \\ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \\nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \\nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\\n\\nAs often as possible, the DoD\\'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \\nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \\nDoD\\'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California\\'s \\n\"Silicon Valley.\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \\nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \\n\"Joust.\"\\n\\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \\nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \\nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \\nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \\nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \\nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\\n\\nThough it\\'s a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \\ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \\nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \\nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it\\'s a great way for kindred spirits to \\nget together.  Long may they flame.\\n\\n\\n\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\"\\t[centerbar]\\n\\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \\nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \\nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \"flames\";  \\nissuing them is called \"flaming.\"  Flames often start when a member \\ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \\ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \\nsomething like:  \"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \\nposeur!\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \\nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \\nability and your cat.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\\n\\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\\n\\nPeriodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised. This is one of\\nthose questions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there\\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do\\nwomen inevitably tell you that you\\'re such a nice guy just before they\\ndump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\\nhalls of academe for generations. \\n\\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\\nsigned it \"The Denizen of Doom\". Not wishing to identify himself, he\\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \\n\\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\\nthe funniest thing he\\'d seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\\nnumber. \\n\\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we\\'re all computer nerds who\\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\\nminded enough to accept us as members. \\n\\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \\n\\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system?

Beats BMWs dead!! \\n\\nMuck: I don\\'t mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW\\n     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer\\n     11 but what the heck.  \\n\\nStompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that\\'s all man.\\n\\nTerrible: Nahhhh, you\\'re sounding like Heritick Ratatnack!

Let\\'s see\\n     what they say, eh? \\n\\nMuck: Now men, let\\'s try to be civil about this.\\n\\nHigh Tech: Hi, I\\'m a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.\\n\\nArlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!\\n\\nTerrible: B.T.???\\n\\nArlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.\\n\\nMuck: Ahhh, look, you\\'re making Terrible gag.\\n\\nTerrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? \\n\\nMuck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.\\n\\nTerrible: Actually, my name is Terrible.

Quist   DoD #94\\n\\n\\n[Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we\\'ll call\\nChuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,\\nwith 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] \\n\\n(editor\\'s note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at\\nthe First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens\\nreferring to each other as \"Chuck\". I guess you had to be there. I\\nwasn\\'t.) \\n\\nChuck:  I didn\\'t want to be a Software Systems Analyst,\\n cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,\\n may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted\\n to live a man\\'s life,\\n[Music slowly builds in background]\\n riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes\\n and the deepest valleys,\\n living the life of a Motorcyclist;\\n doing donuts and evading the police;\\n terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;\\n eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,\\n\\n\\tI Want to be      A Denizen!\\n\\n[Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with\\nfringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of\\nan obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell\\'s Angels\\nsit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,\\nshowering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil\\non the tarmac.

And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.\\n\\nSometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \"What does DoD\\nstand for? It\\'s not the Department of Defense is it?\" Naturally, a\\nDenizen who had watched the movie \"Top Gun\" a few times too many rose\\nto the occasion and replied:\\n\\n\"That\\'s classified, we could tell you, but then we\\'d have to kill you.\"\\n\\nAnd the rest is history.\\n\\nA variation on the \"security\" theme is to supply disinformation about\\nwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where\\nknown) include:\\n\\nDaughters of Democracy (DoD 23)\\t\\tDoers of Donuts\\nDancers of Despair (DoD 9)\\t\\tDebasers of Daughters\\nDickweeds of Denver\\t\\t\\tDriveway of Death\\nDebauchers of Donuts\\t\\t\\tDumpers of Dirtbikes\\n\\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\\nlimited only by the contents of one\\'s imagination or dictionary file.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                     The rec.moto.photo archive\\n\\nFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck\\nRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,\\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\\n\\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\\n\\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\\nto use the archive.\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nVia ftp:\\n\\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\\n\\nVia e-mail:\\n\\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\\n\\ndir [dod]\\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\\n\\nand you\\'ll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\\n\\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\\nthe next whole file) are send.  A \\'send [dod]*.gif\\' would send 150 files of\\n50K each; not a good idea.\\n-- \\nBruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU\\nCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so\\nwhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?\\nSecond, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\\nof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). \\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                      Patches? What patches?\\n\\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &\\npins. And your reaction was probably: \"I want!\", or \"That\\'s sick!\", or\\nperhaps \"That\\'s sick! I want!\"\\n\\nWell, there\\'s some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\\nthere\\'s been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\\nnews is that there isn\\'t anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn\\'t\\nbecause of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no\\n\"DoD store\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\\nsomeone says \"I\\'m thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they\\'ll cost\\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\" Then\\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\\nthis is anarchy in action.\\n\\nHere\\'s a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\\npopular demand].\\n\\nAll \"profits\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\\nyou\\'ll see a large plaque on the Founders\\' Wall in the name of \"Denizens\\nof Doom, USENET, The World\", complete with a DoD pin.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHere\\'s a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\\n\\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\\n~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>\\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\\n\\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\\nthe other day.\\n\\n\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\\n\\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\\nDenizens of Doom!

Rides:\\n\\nSummer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third\\nyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass\\ntrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got\\ntogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north\\nas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of\\nNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great\\nPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for\\nriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have\\ncome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]\\n\\nAlso worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the\\nMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,\\nriding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal\\n2-strokes.  And though it\\'s not an \"official\" (as if anything could be\\nofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races\\nin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters\\nto gather.

SCSI-2 is fully\\n SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it \\n needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be \\n very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst \\n {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst\\n {32-bit/wide and fast}.

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio\\nBooks, Inc.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER(R), 1629 K St. NW, Washington,\\nDC  20006.\\n\\n   Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,\\n1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.\\n\\n  It\\'s now been almost one month since war broke out in the South\\nAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it\\'s only a dispute\\nbetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept\\nFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it\\'s far\\nmore than that.\\n\\n   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a\\ngiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,\\nfierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South\\nAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the\\nhostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on\\nall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the\\nSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.\\n\\n   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of\\nthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a\\ncounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\\n\\n   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\\ntime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\\ncoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\\noverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty\\'s navy cannot\\nsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time\\nwithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British\\nwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon no\\nmatter how risky they may be.\\n\\n   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no\\nchoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That\\nreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered\\nlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will\\nbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by\\nthe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts\\nwill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle\\nlosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice\\nbut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking\\neven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,\\nmy friends, Her Majesty\\'s navy has sailed into a trap.\\n\\n   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,\\nironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we\\'ve been hearing\\ncountless commentators referring to the British task force as an\\n\"armada\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very\\nuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400\\nyears ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,\\nbut it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it\\nchanged the course of history--and it was none other than the\\nEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.\\n\\n   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the\\nreign of England\\'s Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion\\nfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. \\nThey were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake\\nand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada\\nby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped\\nwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of\\nreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered\\nthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely\\nhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake\\'s\\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened\\nthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its\\nexpansion into a truly global empire.\\n\\n   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full\\ncircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the\\nworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now\\nthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again in\\nconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for\\ninvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four\\nhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;\\ntoday, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.\\n\\n   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake\\nPassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of\\nthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain\\'s\\nnaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may\\nwell break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal\\nNavy.\\n\\n   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:\\n\\nTopic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND\\nTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\\nTopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.\\n\\nTopic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\\nit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\\na half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\\nBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\\nFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\\ncountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\\ncalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\\nin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\\nthem.\\n\\n   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\\nis from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \\nAfter 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\\nthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\\nremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\\nand yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\\nwatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\\n\\n   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\\nabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO\\'s\\ndoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it\\'s\\ngot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\\nsubmarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\\neven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \\nWave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\\nand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\\nsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\\nsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\\ngrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\\nnumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\\nalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\\n\\n   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What\\'s this\\nfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\\nmajor media is \"oil.\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\\nunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\\nbut that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\\nexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\\nthis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\\nseizure of South Georgia Island.\\n\\n   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\\nno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\\nGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\\nIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\\nglaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \\nOn top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\\nhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\\nstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\\n\\n   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\\nArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\\nover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\\nArgentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\\nnot Britain.\\n\\n   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\\nhas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\\nSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\\nmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina\\'s\\nleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\\nwere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\\ncould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\\nsetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\\nwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina\\'s\\nmilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\\nIsland at all?\\n\\n   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\\nnot political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\\nenormous military secret.  It\\'s a giant underground installation\\nburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \\nThe real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\\ninstallation, together with two other similar installations which\\nI will describe shortly.\\n\\n   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\\nyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\\nwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\\nWashington.  For the past two months I\\'ve been reporting the\\ndetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\\nand verify them.\\n\\n   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\\nthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\\nthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\\n\\n   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of\\nthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The\\nmutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the\\nRockefeller cartel--and Russia\\'s new rulers in the Kremlin are\\nbehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of\\nthe \"PROJECT Z\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase\\nis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both\\nRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\\nONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the\\nexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around\\nthe world.\\n\\n   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are\\nworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of\\nother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to\\nride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in\\nGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\\nsmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\\nremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\\nsecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the\\nopen.  They will confront the world with the only remaining\\nfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using\\nthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of\\nthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to\\npave the way for world domination very soon by setting off\\nNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\\nand Russia\\'s new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\\nrace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\\n\\n   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\\nbenefitting from war preparations which were started by the\\nRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\\nthe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\\nStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\\nStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\\npower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \\nBut before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\\nboth economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\\nBrothers.\\n\\n   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\\ndomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\\nsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \\nIt was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\\nwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\\ndetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\\ndeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\\nStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \\nThen the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\\nunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\\n\\n   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\\nRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\\nlate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\\nthe war being planned would have very different effects on the\\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\\nStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\\nHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\\nBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\\nstrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\\nrelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\\nthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\\nHemisphere war.\\n\\n   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\\nradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\\nnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\\nwar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\\nvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\\nHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\\nthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\\nit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\\nof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \\nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\\nbut very little of the air changes places.\\n\\n   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\\nnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\\ngenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\\nSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \\nThis was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\\nquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\\ncartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\\ndiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\\nRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\\nthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called \"Coordinator of\\nHemispheric Defense\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \\nSo that takes care of the South American continent and its\\nnatural resources.\\n\\n   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\\ncontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\\nespecially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\\nefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\\nNo. 36.\\n\\n   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\\nmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\\nNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\\nRockefellers.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\\ninstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\\nwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\\nsurviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\\nHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\\nrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\\nwould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\\ngeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\\ninherit the Earth.\\n\\n   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\\nthe war, some means would have to be available to project\\nmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\\nRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\\nbeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\\nmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\\nminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\\nin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\\nreserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\\nNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\\nexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\\nand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\\nsmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\\nessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \\nThe best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\\nnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\\nsecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\\nattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\\nprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\\n\\n   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\\nagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\\nthese plans were still in the early stages of development, the\\nanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\\nSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\\nnaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\\nwhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\\na gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\\nwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\\na huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\\nthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\\nSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\\ncandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\\ncoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\\nwere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \\nOther areas were rejected because they were too close to the\\nequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\\nmany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\\nimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\\nthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\\n\\n   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\\nselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\\nselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\\nthree months ago when I called attention to New Zealand\\'s extreme\\nimportance in the coming war.\\n\\n   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\\nnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\\nclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\\nIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\\ndown virtually to the water\\'s edge.  The other part of the\\ninstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\\nwhich is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island\\nfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.\\n\\n   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since\\nWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even\\ncloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location\\nis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep\\nunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also\\ntoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New\\nZealand site is well situated to command the entire South\\nPacific.\\n\\n   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. \\nThat site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located\\nperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The\\ntall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret\\ninstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. \\nIt is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of\\nNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island\\nwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the\\nnortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from\\nthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britain\\ntook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. \\nSince that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia\\nIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.\\n\\n   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New\\nZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960\\'s. \\nThe techniques were adapted from those used previously to build\\nother large underground facilities, such as the NORAD\\ninstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these\\ntechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve\\nconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. \\nIn this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in\\nappearance both during and after construction.\\n\\n   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let\\nships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well\\ncamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the\\nentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When\\nsealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you\\nknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction\\nprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying\\naround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house\\nthe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and\\ndebris was disposed of at sea.\\n\\n   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be\\noutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake\\ndisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed\\ngreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal\\nrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary\\nof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60\\'s McNamara\\npresided over the public paring back of America\\'s visible\\nmilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantling\\nof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that\\nshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,\\nwas to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in\\nNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!\\n\\n   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication\\nfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and\\nbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar\\nWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two\\nships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is\\nan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true\\nin recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing\\ntechniques.\\n\\n   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret\\ninstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of\\ncertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear\\npowered--nuclear \"subs\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;\\nand yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin\\nwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and\\nfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been\\nfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we\\nconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three\\ncarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft\\nwhose manufacture was financed the same way!\\n\\n   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are\\nall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the\\nsecret naval ships possess one key difference.\\n\\n   Last month I revealed that the so-called \"Stealth Program\" has\\nsucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility\\nshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance\\nby distorting light waves in its vicinity.\\n\\n   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into\\ncrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of\\nthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been\\noutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth\\nprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes\\nbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment that\\ngenerates the field.\\n\\n   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American\\nBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on\\nearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world\\ndomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my\\nfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the United\\nStates Military.  Now it\\'s the American Bolsheviks who are in\\ncontrol, and they are bent on war.\\n\\n   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is\\nbeing called the \"Falklands crisis.\"\\n\\nTopic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\\n\"PROJECT Z\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR\\nWAR ONE.\\n\\n   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here\\nare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in\\nWashington.  It\\'s a plan by which the United States will strike\\nthe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war\\nwith Russia.\\n\\n   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in\\ncertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable\\nwar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in\\nstalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United\\nStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand\\nstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially\\ntheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and\\nrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it\\nwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks\\nthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.\\n\\n   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two\\nmonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for\\nnuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is\\nfast running out.\\n\\n   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward\\nwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in\\nthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are\\nequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the\\nBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the\\nnew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two\\nmutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in\\ncertain ways.\\n\\n   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a\\nlimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between\\nthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting\\nbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning\\npoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,\\nand is responsible for the so-called \"Falkland crisis\" now\\ndominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new\\nrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far\\nshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be\\nsettled between them, but for the time being they have called a\\ntruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly\\nenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.\\n\\n   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to\\nslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. \\nIf they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller\\ncartel in certain political movements which I discussed last\\nsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war\\ntimetable will also give more breathing space for additional\\nanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.\\n\\n   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February\\nthat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very\\nquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect\\nfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.\\n\\n   The exact details of the \"PROJECT Z\" war plan are not known to\\neither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines\\nare known to be as I described last month.\\n\\n   It was decided that military action should be devised that\\nwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the\\nBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the\\nSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working\\ntogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to\\ndevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. \\nThe Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these\\nbases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to\\nattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine\\nprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.\\n\\n   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both\\nsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be\\nattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the\\nBolshevik war plan still workable.\\n\\n   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault\\non the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was\\nno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force\\nwhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside\\nworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the\\nvery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.\\n\\n   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different\\nmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was\\nalso its Achilles\\' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected\\nthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military\\nassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her\\nlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.\\n\\n   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has\\ndominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives\\nwere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government\\nmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland\\nIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to\\nenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine\\ngenerals were not told everything about the situation by any\\nmeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to\\ndo.\\n\\n   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were\\npromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the\\nshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine\\nhands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military\\nassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the\\ntroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller\\ncartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With\\nthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,\\nthe Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.\\n\\n   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack\\nplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,\\nlanded at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia\\nIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old\\nbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they\\nalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,\\nalways nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as\\nexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \"Endurance\" put 22\\nMarines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down\\nthe Argentine flag.\\n\\n   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine\\nJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a\\nboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that\\nSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered\\nthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now\\ncame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from\\nArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.\\n\\n   During late March, Argentine military forces started\\nassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \"Nothing new\",\\nthought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out\\nthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed\\nthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine\\nforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this\\ntime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine\\npublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims\\nto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next\\nday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia\\nIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance\\ninitially that it was just a side show from Argentina\\'s point of\\nview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were\\noverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13\\nalleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian attack plan.\\n\\n   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine\\nforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. \\nBased on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the\\nteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above the\\ncavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was\\nset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian\\nmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,\\nApril 3, the military high command in London finally learned what\\nwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under\\nattack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint\\nRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the\\nmountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a\\nmatter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling\\nof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next\\nstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a\\nweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it\\nwould be a nerve gas.\\n\\n   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the\\nBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be\\ndescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the\\nso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik\\ncontrolled.  That\\'s why Margaret Thatcher always says, \"Me, too\"\\nany time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against\\nRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war\\nplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective\\ncountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered\\nthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.\\n\\n   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval\\narmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of\\nthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding\\naround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling\\nwould break through into the roof of the naval base in about\\nthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South\\nGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The\\nforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend\\nthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships\\nwere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to\\nsail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with\\ntactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance\\ndoors would be suicide.\\n\\n   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was\\nseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. \\nThe same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He\\nwas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the\\nRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack\\npreparations.\\n\\n   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other\\nsecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. \\nThe two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \"Red\\nAlert.\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin\\nbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at\\nsea undergoing \"sea trials\", but that still left seven (7) major\\nships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the\\nnuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina\\'s Foreign Minister,\\nCosta Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was\\nalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. \\nCosta Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from\\ncertain officials.  He got them!\\n\\n   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories\\nabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while\\nnegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. \\nThe Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as\\npossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived\\nin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The\\nofficial stories about \"slow movement\" of the British armada were\\nintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,\\nthe fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,\\nthen it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the\\nannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South\\nGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.\\n\\n   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British\\nfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two\\nweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it\\nwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a\\nshambles of the plan.\\n\\n   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent\\nleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was\\nannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into\\ntrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on\\na single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on\\nSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and\\ncombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In\\nmoments the ship was without any command, its communications and\\nradar silenced.  Then a Russian \"sub\" closed in and quickly\\nfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke\\napart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is\\nknown, there were no survivors.\\n\\n   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two\\nresults, both important:\\n\\nFirst, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\\nby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\\nconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\\nvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about the\\nprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\\narrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\\nout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\\ncommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.\\n\\nThe other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was\\nflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible\\naction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting\\ninvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\\nbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\\nseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in\\nsouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\\nheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\\nof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\\nprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\\nto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I\\nexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the\\nStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded\\ncommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes\\nheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South\\nGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of\\nSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of the\\nSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint\\nRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been\\nflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in\\nNew Zealand!\\n\\n   The British ship\\'s sinking of April 14 was also followed by\\nother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\\nof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\\nAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\\nwas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top\\nGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have\\nrevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did\\nnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four\\ndays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded\\nhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \"Time is running out.\" \\nAnd so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.\\n\\n   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the\\nhollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military\\nanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completed\\nuntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was\\nstill out of range.\\n\\n   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the\\nlong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was\\ndetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the\\neffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed\\neveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the\\nbomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside\\nsufficiently to badly disable them.\\n\\n   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging\\non the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands\\nawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to\\nthe eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\\nagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the\\ntactics which the Russians employed.\\n\\n   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\\nusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \\nAs I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\\nPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\\nof the ships to the attack submarines.  The \"subs\" were armed\\nwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to\\nexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been\\nthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective\\nshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right\\nthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. \\nWithin 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik\\nStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went\\ntheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from\\naround the world.\\n\\n   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local\\ntime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. \\nThat evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public\\nwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was\\nwearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught\\nalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning\\nfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian\\nmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret\\nBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,\\nbottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific\\nfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By\\nworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won\\nthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.\\n\\nTopic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression\\nthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real\\nwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are\\nwatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That\\naftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been\\npromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.\\n\\n   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing\\nfor a public announcement that the United States will side with\\nBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat\\nup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to\\nfight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be\\nexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, the\\nBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and\\ntragic defeat for the Royal Navy.\\n\\n   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now\\nconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On\\nall sides now we are hearing about the so-called \"nuclear freeze\\nmovement.\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all\\nkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent\\nmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on election\\nballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are\\nbanding together to warn the public about what would happen if\\nthere were a nuclear war.\\n\\n   We are being told that all this is just popping up\\nspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and\\nnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet\\nnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have\\nspontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you\\nbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,\\nand I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and\\nmoney--and plenty of it.\\n\\n   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations\\nmachine at work.  As I\\'ve explained in the past, the Rockefeller\\ncartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it\\ndoes, they will lose everything because they are not in a\\nposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the\\nRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is\\na war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in\\nits power to prevent a nuclear war.\\n\\n   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller\\ncartel creates certain temporary common interests between them\\nand Russia; but as Russia\\'s new rulers know very well, this does\\nnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the\\nRockefeller group.  It\\'s purely a matter of practical necessity\\nright now for the Rockefellers.\\n\\n   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and\\nthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with\\nthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of\\nthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear\\nwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of\\nreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.\\n\\n   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective\\nwith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is\\nrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old\\ndream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly\\nprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar\\ncampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan\\nAdministration has become so hawkish that it\\'s scaring people. \\nThe Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on\\nthat latent fear as a tool of power.\\n\\n   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands\\ncrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller\\npropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that\\nsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new\\nsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the\\nbill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new\\norganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working\\nname, though this may be changed, is the \"World Nonproliferation\\nCouncil.\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of\\nnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be\\nto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.\\n\\n                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY\\n\\n   Now it\\'s time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO\\nLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called\\nFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret\\nBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern\\nHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the\\nRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down\\nthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the\\nresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal\\nNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain\\'s Waterloo at sea\\nmay well be at hand.\\n\\n   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our\\nUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They\\ndiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we\\nare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the\\npower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture\\ntells us, our Lord \"...has not given us the spirit of fear; but\\nof power, of love, and of a sound mind.\"  We must learn to wage\\npeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, \"Blessed are the\\npeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.\"\\n\\n   Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you,\\nand may God bless each and every one of you.\\x1a\\n',\n",

This is the\\n: Jewish interpretation, and is supported by Jewish commentaries on\\n: these verses.\\n:    This is quite an embarrassment for pro-lifer Christians, so there is\\n: of course an alternate explanation.  The alternative interprets the\\n: word \"miscarriage\" to mean \"premature birth\"--i.e., the child is born\\n: alive--and \"further injury\" to mean injury to either the woman or\\n: the fetus.  This is not a straightforward interpretation, it is not\\n: (so far as I know) supported by any Jewish commentaries, and it does\\n: not appeared to be supported by any other part of the Bible.\\n\\nWhat if any, historical reference do we have to abortion at this time?  Did\\nthe ancient Jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion? (I am\\ntruly asking, not making a point veiled as a question).  If there is \\nlittle understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion, it is\\nnot surprising the Bible makes little reference to it, as it makes little\\nreference to nuclear power and contamination.\\n\\nWhile your interpretation is a reasonable one, I see no reason to reject\\nthe other out of hand.  The King Jimmy translation says \"if there is no\\nfurther mischief.\"  This does not necessarily imply to the woman.  I know\\nif my wife we expecting and someone cause her to spontaneously abort, we\\nwould feel that a life was truly taken, not simply a process halted.\\n',\n",

I\\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\\n\\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\\n\\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\\nthe space station.\\n\\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\\navailable funds.\\n\\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\\nthe NASA budget for the President\\'s new technology\\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\\n\\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\\nconsider.\\n\\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\\n\"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the\\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\\n\\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\\nachieving that goal.\\n\\nGibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is\\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\\nthe future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\nNASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-\\nWest Space Science Center at the University of Maryland\\nunder the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.\\n\\n',\n",

Later, she decided\\nthat she couldn\\'t wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was\\ndeath.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is\\nseparation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not\\nbecause He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go\\nthere.  \\n\\n>> did you know that Jesus talked more\\n>> about hell than He did about heaven!  \\n\\n>Thank you for this info.

One must have correct\\nknowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.\\n Jesus most certainly felt the \"pinpricks\" of life.  As the Scripture say:\\n\\nHeb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our\\nweaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without\\nsin.\\n\\nThe kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes\\nwhen He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine\\nto think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \"The Consciousness of\\nChrist.\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this\\ninteresting study, including clh.  \\n\\nIt is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually\\nsuffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we\\ndo.  He \"grew in knowledge.\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose\\nto be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \"led of the Spirit\" to such\\nan extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and\\nJesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him,\\nthe tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise. \\nThat is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was\\nliving sequential history as you or I.  \\n\\nMaybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion\\nand one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than\\nnot.\\n\\n>Thanks again for the info.  Just so you know, some friends and I\\n>     are starting a Freethinkers organization-- and I\\'m going to\\n>     use some of the info you provided for an organization intro-\\n>     duction... :-)\\n\\nI was once a member of that club.  THe \"free thinker\" is a glorious ideal.  By\\ncontrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository\\nof everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find\\nsuch a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist\\nwishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right. \\nBut what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \"rational\\ndoubt\" when in fact he was led to it by his \"faith\".  He must acknowledge that\\nwhile it is rational doubt for him as a \"free thinker\" to criticize the\\nChristian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize\\nhim as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no\\nfaith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.\\n\\nPascal pointed out that \"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.\\n Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\"  The fact that skeptics are not\\nskeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must\\nbelieve in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or\\neven most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a\\nmeasure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define\\nhimself only in negative terms, hence the term \"a\"-theist.\\n\\nSome people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In\\nmy campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember. \\nHowever, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word,\\nevery point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication\\nspeaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make\\nsense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.\\n\\nThat is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism\\nis arbitrary.  Next time you\\'re in a room of skeptics, yell out \"Look, your fly\\nis undone!\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he\\nbelieves without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it\\nunderlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he\\nknows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity. \\nThe answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on\\npresuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before\\nit is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and\\ncritical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective\\nand neutral.  In other words, another myth.  \\n\\nPresuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is\\nsomething we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can\\nbe criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are\\nour silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for\\nabsence.\\n\\n>  I tell you what-- if God condemns me for being honest, He is\\n>    unworthy of my worship.  Better to burn in Hell than to\\n>     serve a tyrant in Heaven..\\n\\nOf course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had\\nbeen in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \"Highlander\" movie. \\nBut again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of\\nGod.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic\\ntheology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His\\nprophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you\\nare to reject God\\'s annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct\\nunderstanding of Himself.\\n\\n--Rex\\n',\n",

Guy didn\\'t hit a lick, had\\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don\\'t \\nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn\\'t field,\\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\\nOBP wasn\\'t THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \\n\\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80\\'s.  I know that\\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn\\'t overrated by the media.  \\n\\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one\\'s actually pretty close.  He\\'s had a s\\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \\n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I\\'d have to take a closer look at the stats (it\\'s been \\na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \\n\\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn\\'t mean a whole hell of a lot if you \\nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \\nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \\nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\\n\\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF\\'er.\\n\\n>     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody\\n>giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today\\'s standards,\\n>marginal.\\n\\n\\tLemme ask you this.

Big deal.\\n>Let\\'s be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so\\n>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something\\n\\n\\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he\\'s won something along\\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \\ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie\\'s more\\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\\n80\\'s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie\\'s\\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power (\\'cept against Tom Niedenfuer\\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\\n\\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\\nstiff.  His \\'82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\\nSS numbers go.  He\\'s a clear HOF\\'er, IMHO.\\n\\n>isn\\'t done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When \\n>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential \\n>candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to\\n>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?\\n\\n\\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you\\'re right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \\ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn\\'t be in the HOF.\\n\\tSkyJack?  I\\'ve said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\\nabout Morris\\' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris\\' \"ability\\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in \\'93, he may be damned \\nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\\n80\\'s for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\\nnot favorites.  Morris\\' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\\n\"consideration\".  \\n\\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \\nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he\\'s \\njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\\n(Of course, Nolan\\'s a HOF\\'er...)\\n\\tPuck?  Probably, although he\\'s got to play reasonably well for a few\\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren\\'t enough to make the HOF, most\\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \\ntragic or sudden).  He\\'s very popular in the media and with fans, and\\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF\\'s in the game since he joined the\\nleague.  I\\'ve always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it\\'s too early to sell.\\n\\n\\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \\nor not, I never tire of it.

I do\\nnot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and\\nopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know\\nthat\\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\\nby the death penalty.\\n\\nMy understanding is that Khomeini\\'s ruling was not based on the\\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\\nprecedent in the Qur\\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\\n\\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\\n\\n\\n> Stuff deleted\\n> Also, I think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that\\n> Khomeini\\'s fatwa was issued due to the _distribution_ of the book.

However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people, not books.\\n\\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \\nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\\n\\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\\n\\nP.S. I\\'m not sure about this but I think the charge of \"shatim\" also\\napplies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella\\nof the \"fasad\" ruling.\\n',\n",

In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts\\n> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I\\n> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.\\n\\nI abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from\\nothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do\\nnot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in\\nthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \\nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\\ndiscussing the \"Potter\\'s Field.\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n    Precise knowledge is the only true knowledge, and he who does not teach\\n    exactly, does not teach at all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHenry Ward Beecher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAmerican Clergyman\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas recorded by George Seldes\\n',\n",

The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde\\n>produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to\\n>living cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.  \\n\\n[...]\\n\\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\\n\\n   [Reproduced without permission]\\n\\n\\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\\n\\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\\n\\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\\n\\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\\n\\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\\n\\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\\n\\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\\n\\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\\n\\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\\n\\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\\n\\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\\n\\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\\n\\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\\n\\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\\n\\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\\n\\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\\n\\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\\n\\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\\n\\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\\n\\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\\n\\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\\n\\n\\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\\n\\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\\n\\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\\n\\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\\n\\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\\n\\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\\n\\tafter the sweetener\\'s entering the market have failed to confirm\\n\\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That\\'s why the\\n\\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\\n\\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association\\'s\\n\\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\\n\\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\\n\\tclean bill of health.\\n\\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\\n\\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\\n\\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\\n\\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\\n\\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\\n\\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\\n\\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\\n\\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\\n\\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\\n\\tof selected foods omitted]\\n\\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\\n\\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\\n\\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\\n\\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\\n\\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\\n\\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\\n\\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\\n\\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\\n\\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\\n\\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\\n\\n\\n-Rich Young (These are not Kodak\\'s opinions.)\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"From: 18669@bach.udel.edu (Steven R Hoskins)\\nSubject: Some questions from a new Christian\\nOrganization: University of Delaware\\nLines: 40\\n\\nHi,\\n\\nI am new to this newsgroup, and also fairly new to christianity. I was\\nraised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an\\nagnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the\\nChristian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I am\\nhappy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and\\nquite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying\\nto rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful\\nto also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other\\nrelevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I would\\nlike to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological\\nworks intended for a lay person?\\n\\nI have another question I would like to ask. I am not yet affiliated\\nwith any one congregation. Aside from matters of taste, what criteria\\nshould one use in choosing a church? I don't really know the difference\\nbetween the various Protestant denominations.\\n\\nThanks for reading my post. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSteve Hoskins\\n\\n[Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an\\nintroduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible\\ncourses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary\\nstyles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further\\nreading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT\\nintroduction.  There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  They\\noften have background articles that are helpful.  Probably the best\\nrecommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  (I\\nthink there may be a couple of books with this title.  This is a\\nfairly recent one, like about 1990, done in cooperation with the\\nSociety for Biblical Criticism.)  If you are committed to inerrancy,\\nyou will probably prefer something more conservative.  I don't read a\\nlot of conservative books, but a commentary I looked at by Donald\\nGuthrie looked rather good.  He has a NT Introduction, and he's also\\neditor of Eerdman's Bible Commentary.  --clh]\\n\",\n",

The machine is 3 years old\\nand I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for\\ntwo and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining\\n5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing.\\nThe error message reported was like:\\n\\nSector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.\\n\\nThis occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the\\ndiagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after\\nreinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes\\n2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors,\\nbut still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall\\nSystem 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however,\\nI now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:\\n\\n   o Frequent crashes\\n   o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to\\n       correct.\\n   o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.\\n       - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the\\n         disk either.\\n       - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes\\n         requires several attempts.\\n\\nQUESTIONS:\\n\\n   1) Has anyone had this type of problem before?\\n   2) Is the problem with the fx motherboard (And its non-standard\\n      SCSI implementation) or with my Maxtor Disk? Is there some\\n      diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?\\n   3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest\\n      and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the\\n      end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx\\n      terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal\\n      drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with\\n      one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago).\\n      I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices;\\n      so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue.

The heat source\\nis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it\\'s a vertical wooden box with\\nventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air\\nto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are\\nspaced every 6\" starting about 10\" above the bulb.\\n\\nOr, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use\\nyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may\\nnot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or\\nracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my\\noven - if yours goes down to 120 that\\'s probably even better.)  Stick a\\nwooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close\\nthe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows\\nfor airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it\\noften, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are\\nusing cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway\\nthrough.\\n\\nIf you want more info, e-mail me since this isn\\'t really the right sub\\nfor this stuff.\\n\\ngerald.belton@ozonehole.com\\n\\n\\n * SLMR 2.1 * I still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.\\n                       \\n----\\nThe Ozone Hole BBS * A Private Bulletin Board Service * (504)891-3142\\n3 Full Service Nodes * USRobotics 16.8K bps * 10 Gigs * 100,000 Files\\nSKYDIVE New Orleans! * RIME Network Mail HUB * 500+ Usenet Newsgroups\\nPlease route all questions or inquiries to:  postmaster@ozonehole.com\\n',\n",

Does anone have any information\\n\\nI\\'m not sure that this condition is \"recognised\" anywhere (in the\\nsense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries\\nbetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic\\nfeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.\\n\\nPost-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease\\nby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities\\nare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of\\nongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of\\ndeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.\\nMusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless\\ncontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows\\nmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old\\ndenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit\\naction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation\\n(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation\\nwith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active\\ndenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme\\nstaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.\\n\\nPost-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically\\nevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,\\nthe patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one\\nyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio\\nbefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among\\npolio survivors than among people who never had polio.\\n\\nThe cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little\\nevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or\\ndestructive immunologic response to virus antigen.\\n\\nThere is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have\\nanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,\\nmotor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than\\npatients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.\\nBoth groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason\\nfor these \"acute\" changes in a \"chronic\" disease (old polio) is\\nunknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge\\nnumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several\\nyears.\\n\\nThere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio\\nsyndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny\\ndeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe\\npolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.\\nThey also tend to score higher on depression scales of\\nneuropsychologic tests.\\n\\nMy take on this (I\\'m sure some will disagree):  after recovery from\\nsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,\\nligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or\\ndegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing\\npain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads\\nto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am\\nperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS\\npatient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe\\nthat PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than\\nnon-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but\\nwithout PPS complaints).\\n---\\n .

I don\\'t think it is the\\nfunction overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time\\nin BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in\\nporting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of\\ninvalid C++ assumptions.\\n\\nI have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but\\nthe reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in\\nwhich static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are\\ngetting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the\\nowner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all\\nother pieces of ctrltest work fine.\\n\\nTwo other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:\\n\\n- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,\\n  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ\\n  between MSC and BC).\\n\\n- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++\\n  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place\\n  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for\\n  references).\\n\\nI am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have\\nnot encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope\\nthat some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS\\'s\\nhype about portability to other vendor\\'s compilers will be just that.\\n\\n-- \\n      If these were my employer\\'s opinions, I wouldn\\'t be posting them.\\n###############################################################################\\n  \"Whoever said nothing lasts forever was obviously  # R.

Both Astacio AND Martinez\\nwere bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.\\nMartinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might\\nhave seen him lifted in the third in past years.\\n \\nAstacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.\\nThe Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls\\nin the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great\\non defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to\\nsteal and has at least one pick off at first.\\n \\nWallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on\\ndefense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers\\nsome runs.

If there\\nisn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are\\napparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they\\ncould just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of\\nboth speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)?\\n\\nQuadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge),\\nso maybe this is a ROM problem?

It needs a strong\\nhand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong\\nas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.

I haven\\'t seen it,\\nor any followup traffic relating to it in these groups or other groups\\nwhich I subscribe to.  So, I am posting it here so others can read it,\\ncheck it out, and comment on it, and provide ideas for handling these\\nsorts of things.\\n\\nI have no verification to the accuracy or lack of accuracy of this\\narticle, but if accurate, I find it extremely disturbing, especially in\\nlight of various abuses of the SSN number regarding privacy, (I understand\\nit is now to be required in CA to renew a drivers license, or to register\\na car) and other proposals regarding \\'smart\\' national Identity Cards,\\nwiretap proposals, and such.  One simply wonders what other gems are in\\nthe wings ready to be sprung on the people by our government.  Perhaps\\nsuggestions and ideas for preventing this and other such proposals from\\nacquiring the force of law would be useful.  The cost simply outweighs\\nany possible benefits, IMO.\\n\\nBTW, reading this makes me think of some ideas a Prof Denning has been\\npromoting, in an even more disturbing form.\\n\\nThat said, with no further comment, the article follows:\\n\\n------------ Begin included article ---------\\n\\nNote:  This file will also be available via anonymous file\\ntransfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and\\nvia the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.\\n     ---------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                         THE WHITE HOUSE\\n\\n                  Office of the Press Secretary\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\n\\nFor Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993\\n\\n\\n                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY\\n\\n\\nThe President today announced a new initiative that will bring\\nthe Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary\\nprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephone\\ncommunications while meeting the legitimate needs of law\\nenforcement.\\n\\nThe initiative will involve the creation of new products to\\naccelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\\ntelecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\\n\\nFor too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\\nprivate sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\\ntension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\\nprotecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\\n\\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n     of these products.\\n\\n----------- End included article ----------- \\n\\n-- \\npat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle, WA\\n         If all else fails, try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!pat\\nWISDOM: \"Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity,\\n         and I am not sure about the former.\"              - Albert Einstien\\n',\n",

The attempts to quiet any violence\\n    in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder\\n    and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and\\n    came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move\\n    like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts\\n    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find \\n    your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than\\n    anti-Israel bigotry.\\n\\n\\n>The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population\\n>density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks.\\n>The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of\\n>Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the\\n>strip and seek work in Israel.\\n\\n    It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by\\n    residents of Gaza.  You self-servingly omit any references to\\n    WHY Israel has had to take action.  Apparaently the deaths of\\n    innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a\\n    racist ommission on your part.\\n\\n\\n>While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the\\n>Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help\\n>the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli\\n>Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.\\n>\\n>The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is\\n>recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of\\n>justice.

Israeli civilians have\\n    been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave\\n    of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the\\n    basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing\\n    but an anti-Israel charade.\\n\\n\\n>As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of\\n>Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are\\n>considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops\\n>and fields. \\n\\n    Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli\\n    citizenship and were denied?  I have heard of no such denials\\n    taking place.  Can you document this, or is this more of your\\n    stupid and innacurate propaganda?  The truth is that if Gazan\\n    residents applied for citizenship, HAMAS would murder them as\\n    collaborators.\\n\\n\\n\\t     Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in\\n>Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for\\n>the Master Race.\\n\\n    How dare you use such a disgusting phrase.  How very easy you\\n    attack a people, when you omit facts which fly in the face of\\n    your pure racism.  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the\\n    racists that you are.  Do you believe that all Jews must have   \\n    the same bigoted makeup as you?  \\n    \\n    Here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master \\n    race,' for you to avoid...\\n\\n    Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to\\n    seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to\\n    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the\\n    responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,\\n    Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had\\n    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved\\n    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make\\n    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR\\n    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved\\n    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth\\n    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back\\n    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of\\n    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called\\n    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary\\n    in Lebanon.  \\n\\n    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other\\n    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of\\n    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just\\n    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney\\n    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an\\n    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort\\n    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to\\n    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons\\n    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard\\n    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich \\n    nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight \\n    of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or\\n    your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT\\n    the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is\\n    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.\\n\\n\\n>The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the\\n>right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the\\n>occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some\\n>Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over\\n>Gaza through Arab collaborators.\\n\\n    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your\\n    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a\\n    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or\\n    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take\\n    something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do\\n    not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is\\n    to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a \\n    difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You\\n    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of \\n    the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single\\n    most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it\\n    is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most\\n    evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it\\n    were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast\\n    problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic\\n    manner.\\n\\n\\n>As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible\\n>with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming\\n>Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for\\n>self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish\\n>society does not consider Gazans full human beings. \\n\\n    And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is\\n    not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had\\n    taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land\\n    Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS\\n    started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a \\n    completely different set of international laws?  Since you do\\n    continuously refer to international law, would you please say\\n    what specific international laws Israel is violating?  \\n    \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   This attitude\\n>is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews. \\n\\n    I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not.\\n\\n\\n>                                                             The\\n>current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are\\n>consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister\\n>Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'. \\n\\n    Where is this quote?  I have never heard Rabin assert that he\\n    wished such a thing.  Since you are in general a liar, you'll\\n    have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort\\n    will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.\\n\\n\\n>                                           One is led to ask\\n>oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister\\n>goals towards the Gazans ?

Do you have an\\n    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,\\n    what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what\\n    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the\\n    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims \\n    in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death\\n    and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk\\n    are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel\\n    has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to \\n    the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The\\n    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being\\n    killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.\\n    They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept\\n    from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.\\n    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the\\n    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your \\n    life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.    \\n\\n    Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual\\n    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself\\n    what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the\\n    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your\\n    case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe\\n    you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born\\n    a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is\\n    being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a\\n    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these\\n    fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your \\n    own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be, \\n    it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to \\n    appear to be.  When you realize that you can't care for other \\n    people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do \\n    some good.\\n \\n    But for now, you are a fruad.\\n\\n\\n \\n\",\n",

The 27th was a short day at\\nwork, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided\\nto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal\\nFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had\\nwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes\\nbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24\\nVolga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the \\ncar. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,\\nand the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn\\'t have anything on her head, and \\nher hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They\\'re 40 to \\n45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help\\nthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?\\n\\nWhen I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn\\'t see what it was, \\nbut it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the \\nEternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle\\naround it. I ask, \"What\\'s going on?\" Someone tells me, \"Come listen.\" Well\\nthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \"Brother\\nMuslims, our time has come . . . \" and something else along that line. I\\ndidn\\'t understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to \\nget a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. \\nNew people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And\\nthe comments started: \"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\" and \"There\\'s\\nno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\" I even heard that: \"All \\nMoscow is behind us.\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this \\nwas no joke. I quietly left and went home.\\n\\nNow before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, \\nthat there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of \\nthings, but I didn\\'t have any idea what was really going on.\\n\\nMy wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt\\'s house in Baku. \\nI didn\\'t say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two\\no\\'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and \\nshouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,\\nlike they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a \\ndemonstration and move slowly.\\n\\nMy wife asks what\\'s going on out there. I say I don\\'t know. I put on some\\noutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd\\npeople are shouting \"Down with the Armenians!\" and \"Death to the Armenians!\" I\\nwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street \\non the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned \\nand went against the traffic--it\\'s one way there--down the Street of the 26 \\nBaku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there \\nwas a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same \\nkind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside \\nfrom the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young\\npeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.\\n\\nMy wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of\\nuneasy and said, \"No, let\\'s stay at home instead.\" An hour went by, or maybe \\nan hour and a half. Well, I wasn\\'t keeping track of the time, I can\\'t say\\nexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on\\nthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.\\n\\nI put outside clothes on and went out again. There\\'s noise, an uproar outside,\\nand the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time \\nthere were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more \\naggressive. No, I think, something\\'s wrong here, this isn\\'t any demonstration.\\nThey would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run \\nagain. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I \\nfollowed them. I was thinking I\\'d just watch and see. Who knew where this was \\nleading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one \\nside, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square \\nand heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There \\nwas some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.\\nI heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \"We don\\'t need \\nperestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" Now what did they \\nmean by \"living like we have been?\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. \\nBut too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense \\nof others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just \\nin Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I\\'ve never seen it \\nanywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.\\n\\nNow at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians\\' \\napartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn\\'t \\nhear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, I only heard \"beat them and \\ndrive them out.\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then\\nanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off\\nto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and \\nI think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.\\nThere were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn\\'t see any of them try \\nto pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.\\n\\nWell I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no\\ndemonstration, and I had to protect my family.\\n\\nI left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next\\nto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-\\nlor\\'s shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-\\nthing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because\\nafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons\\nin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City \\nParty Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I \\nsaw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the \\ncases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 \\nto 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried \\noff by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing\\nright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe \\nabout the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. \\nWhen I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was \\nabout a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He \\nhas a package in his hand, and he\\'s pulling out anasha and handing it out. I \\nhave never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I\\'ve seen a lot of \\npeople smoke it, I\\'ve seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled \\naround and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.\\n\\nBefore I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. \\nI turned around and saw them running. Well I\\'ll just keep on going like I am, \\nI thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. \\nAnd I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the \\nstreet. He\\'s a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, \\nwhich had \"Ermeni oryum\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \"Death to \\nArmenians!\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don\\'t really\\nknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father\\'s name is\\nRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark\\nblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His \\nfamily, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on \\nNarimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; \\ntheir apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the \\nleft. Now Rafik\\'s little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a \\nnew apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son \\nwas carrying a flag that said \"Death to Armenians!\" I was surprised because \\nbefore this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being \\ndone not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.\\n\\nWell anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \"It\\'s OK, it\\'ll pass, \\nthey\\'re young kids, they\\'ve just gotten all whooped up.\" Naturally I didn\\'t \\nwant her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And \\nthis time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn\\'t \\nsee where. Well I think, here we go, the machine\\'s in motion. They weren\\'t \\nhanding out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn\\'t see people drinking \\nand smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn\\'t unloaded the vodka and \\nhashish to put in a store window!\\n\\nSo the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one \\nwould stop them now, they weren\\'t even trying, although, I\\'ll say it again, \\nthe police were there, I saw them. And it\\'s not just that the police weren\\'t \\nbreaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. \\nTrue, at the time I couldn\\'t even imagine that under our government, our much-\\nvaunted leadership--and I\\'m not afraid to say these words: so many people \\ndied, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I \\ncouldn\\'t imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be \\nspecific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of \\nSumgait, I couldn\\'t imagine that such things could take place.\\n\\nWhen they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \"Let\\'s go upstairs.\" \\nWe went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the \\nevening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.\\nI stopped at \"The Corner,\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I \\nlook and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to \\nthe bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. \\nThe crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed \\ntoward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, \\nwheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as \\nthough it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more \\nnoise, and the glass was flying again.\\n\\nWe spent the night at the neighbors\\'. My apartment was on the first floor,\\nthere was really no way to defend yourself there.\\n\\nIn the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. \\nOn the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or \\nwhat happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the \\nbread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying \\nthere hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing\\nyou couldn\\'t even see him.\\n\\nThat was on the morning of February 28.

Maybe\\n\\nPC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal finance\\nmanagement programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.  PC World,\\nDecember 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money.\\nI can email you copies of these articles if you can\\'t find them at your\\nlibrary.\\n\\nI\\'ve been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have\\nseveral friends who use Quicken, though I\\'ve not used it myself.  My\\noverall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager\\nwhile Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your\\nfinances.\\n\\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:\\n\\n\\tThe ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:\\n\\tchecking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile\\n\\tyour account statements with the records the program keeps.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to make a budget and track your spending against that\\n\\tbudget.\\n\\n\\tA Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill\\n\\tpaying service to pay your bills via your modem.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe ability to print checks on your printer.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts\\n\\tup to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically\\n\\tvia modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I\\'m not sure about it.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation\\n\\tprograms.\\n\\n\\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that\\nQuicken does not:\\n\\n\\tA tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to\\n\\tpredict your tax liability for the coming year.  It\\'s usefull to fine\\n\\ttune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn\\'t get his due too early.\\n\\n\\tAn insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep\\n\\trecords of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.\\n\\tIt can also compute your life expectancy.\\n\\n\\tA financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest, \\n\\teffects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to\\n\\tmaturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and\\n\\tloan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you \\n\\tdecide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford\\n\\ta particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good\\n\\tinvestment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether\\n\\ta particular investment\\'s cash flow is adequate for your situation.\\n\\tThis module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping\\n\\tyour kids with their tuition.  \\n\\n\\tA net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets\\n\\tand liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this \\n\\tinformation.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules\\n\\tare automatically included here.\\n\\n\\tA \"desk\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file\\n\\tyou can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital\\n\\tinformation about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a\\n\\trudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment\\n\\tlist, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to\\n\\ttrack such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list\\n\\tcan be made to display automatically when you start the program.\\n\\nThere are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I\\'m almost\\nsure that Quicken doesn\\'t do everything I\\'ve listed.  If I\\'m wrong, I\\'m sure\\nhordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.\\n\\nOne thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a \\nWindows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version\\nof Managing Your Money for release late this year.\\n\\nI hope this information is of use to you.  I\\'ve found Managing Your Money to\\nbe a very usefull program for keeping my financial records.  On the other hand\\nI know many people who are equally as happy with Quicken.  If Quicken has all\\nthe features you need or want, I\\'d go with it. If you find any of the Managing\\nYour Money features that Quicken doesn\\'t have to be useful, I think it\\'s well\\nworth the price.\\n',\n",

Here is some \\ninformation \"from the horse\\'s mouth\".\\n\\n(Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media (\"clearing\") meant to \\nbe *retained* within the controlled environment, or declassifying \\nthe material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment,)\\n\\nFrom National Telecommunications and Information Systems \\nSecurity (NTISS) \"Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation \\nSecurity Guidelines\"  (NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87):\\n\\n------\\n\\n\"7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media\\n\\nCertain types of removable media (e.g., magnetic tape, floppy disk, \\ncassettes, and magnetic cards) may be cleared by overwriting the \\nentire media one time with any one character.  Floppy disks may be \\ncleared by applying a vendor\\'s formatting program that overwrites \\neach location with a given character.\\n\\nFixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting \\nat least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by \\napplying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each \\nlocation on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that \\nthis program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware: \\nsome programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not \\nactually do this.\\n\\nCleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or \\nreleased for destruction; however, they should be marked and \\ncontrolled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of \\ninformation ever recorded.\\n\\n7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media\\n\\nCertain types of removable media can be declassified using a \\ndegaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of \\nthat type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)\\n\\nIf a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is \\noperative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to \\nemploy an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all \\naddressable locations at least three times by writing any character, \\nthen its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros) \\nalternatively.\\n\\nWhen fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify \\nthe media by the overwrite method.  In this case, there are two \\nalternate procedures that may be used: (1) disassemble the disk \\npack, and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved \\ndegaussing equipment; and (2) courier the inoperative media to the \\nvendor\\'s facility, have the magnetic media (e.g., disk platter) \\nremoved in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for \\ndestruction at the secure site.  The vendor can then install new \\nplatters and repair any other problems with the disk unit.\\n\\n7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media\"\\n\\n[see DoD Computer Security Center, \"Department of Defense Magnetic \\nRemanence Security Guideline\", CSC-STD-003-85  FOR OFFICIAL USE \\nONLY]\\n\\n------\\n\\nThis and many other interesting documents (many that are more \\ninformative than probably intended) on computer security procedures \\ncan be obtained (free) from:\\n\\nExecutive Secretary\\nNational Telecommunications and Informations\\n  Systems Security Committee\\nNational Security Agency\\nFort George G.

       " 'From: frank@marvin.contex.com (Frank Perdicaro)\\nSubject: ST1100 ride\\nKeywords: heavy\\nLines: 95\\n\\nSixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,\\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \\nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\\n\\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\\na big moto party.\\n\\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \\nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \\nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\\nbicycle!  \\'It cant be that heavy\\' I thought.\\n\\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \\nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \\ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\\n\\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \\ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \\nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\\n\\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \\nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \\nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\\nbuzz.\\n\\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \\nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \\nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\\n\\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy\\'s wrist, our singal\\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \\nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \\nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \\nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\\n\\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \\nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \\nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\\n\\n\\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I\\'d buy on for about $3000 less than \\nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.\\n-- \\n\\t Frank Evan Perdicaro \\t\\t\\t\\tXyvision Color Systems\\n      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.\\t\\t101 Edgewater Drive\\n   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572\\t\\t\\t\\tWakefield MA\\nouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572\\t\\t018801285\\n',\n",

Here are some observations gained from\\npainful experience:\\n\\n  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.\\n     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more\\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\\n\\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\\n     that these things will itch for months.\\n\\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC\\'s special\\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\\n     required to get it.\\n\\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn\\'t work.  I recall\\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\\n\\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\\n     another preparation called \"Chig Away\" that is a combination of\\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\\n     up on weekends since I literally can\\'t go outside where we\\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\\n     apparently don\\'t like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\\n\\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\\n     (relieves the itch).  I won\\'t tell you all the things I\\'ve tried.\\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\\n     it gains nothing).\\n\\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\\n     as well.\\n\\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\\ndoctors apparently don\\'t encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\\nwould make a *lot* of money.\\n-- \\nGary H.

Jesus is the head of the body, the church\\n   B.  You cannot say \"yes\" to Jesus, but \"no\" to the church\\n\\nEphesians 2:19-22\\n   A.  The church is the family of God\\n   B.  The church is based on the Word of God only\\n          Cornerstone=Christ\\n          Foundation= Apostles=New Testament\\n                      Prophets=Old Testament  (see Revelation 21:9-14)\\n\\n1 Corinthians 12:12-13\\n   A.  Baptism is when we become a member of the church\\n\\nAs for the question of denominations:\\n   A.  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians\\n4:4-6, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13\\n   B.  1 Corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions in\\nthe church.  There should be no following of personalities in the church\\n(and in time, their writings)\\n   C.  There are so many churches today because of a problem.  2 Timothy\\n4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a\\nchurch that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle\\n\\nHebrews 10:24-25\\n   A.  Do not miss church\\n   B.  Purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful.\\nInvolved on a relationship level in the church\\n   C.  Must come to ALL services\\n\\nAnother verse which is helpful is Hebrews 3:12-15.  The church should be\\nencouraging daily, as it is their duty to do.\\n\\nOf course, more standards apply:\\n   1 Timothy 4:16  People in the church should be watching their lives\\nand doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely (ie,\\ndisciples).\\n   Acts 17:10-12  The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul\\n(natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directly\\nface to face), so if the Bereans, who were considered noble, didn\\'t take\\nPaul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verify\\nhis statements, then church members are to do the same and verify the\\npastor\\'s statements.  If they are not verifiable or valid in light of\\nother verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (would\\'ve\\nmade a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group, especially in light of\\nMatthew 24).\\n\\nJoe Fisher\\n',\n",

The goalie\\nwho gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series\\nfor his team.\\n\\nEposode Summary\\n---------------\\nThis episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that\\nhe bought from the concession stand.\\n\\nRon Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the\\nToronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow\\nand proclaimed \"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks\\nof me. Beauty.\"\\n\\nNext, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to\\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\\nthe arenas in the NHL.\\n\\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game\\nhad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game\\nin the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All\\nstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary\\nby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most\\npenalties gets to ref in the finals.\\n\\nNext, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for\\nthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the\\nwins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup\\nand the AHL championships.\\n\\nFinally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the\\nRangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.\\nDon feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had\\nseveral key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who\\nwent cold.\\n\\nDon had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party\\'s over,\\nAdolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer\\nbe a \\'country club\\'.... \"NY should be achamed of themselves... If\\nthey go in the tank with Adolf there, they\\'ll be hanging from the\\nyardarm by their thumbs.\"\\n\\n\\nRating\\n------\\nNothing too special in this episode.\\n\\nI\\'ll give it a 5.5 out of 10.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   \\\\  \\\\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\\n    \\\\  \\\\                  |Department of Computing Science,\\n     \\\\  \\\\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\\n      \\\\    ###  \\\\     _   |---------------------------------------------------\\n       \\\\___###___\\\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\\n credit...\"          - U. of A.

Dr. Teperman \\ntrained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant \\nDirector of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University \\nMedical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in \\ntransplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is \\na long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and \\nalways a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a \\nvery informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our \\nhospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence \\nwill be well prepared, and at last the weather should be \\ncooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome \\nDr. Teperman. \\n\\n          WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE\\n\\n\\nLAST MEETING\\n\\nIt has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of \\nTRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being \\nable to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  \\nNo TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored \\nagain, but we were also able to disable the Long Island \\nRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many \\nbraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good \\nconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, \\na professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not \\nable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to \\ndiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, \\nan image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient \\nwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman \\ngave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, \\n(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to \\nminimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine \\nand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank \\nher for an entertaining evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nANNUAL MEETING\\n\\nIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is \\nalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official \\nnotice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main \\npurpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit \\nmember views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and \\nto elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two \\nyear term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following \\nslate for the Board.\\n\\n         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen\\n         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith\\n         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia\\n         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)\\n         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)\\n         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)\\n         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)\\n\\nThose remaining on the Board for another year are:\\n\\n         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)\\n         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn\\n         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy\\n         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)\\n         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)\\n         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)\\n\\nThis may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work \\nand with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have \\nbackups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition \\nto the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also \\nbe accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board \\nmembers and there is plenty of work. \\n\\nIn addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be \\ngiven and the floor will be open for any new business, \\nsuggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.\\n\\nWe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the \\nmajority of the time with Dr. Teperman.\\n\\nFUTURE MEETINGS\\n\\nRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  \\n\\n     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry\\n                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center\\n\\n     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony \\n                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. \\n\\nPlan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.\\n\\nNOTDAW\\n\\nThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor \\nAwareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, \\nspeaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and \\nGaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   \\nbecause of two year's experience with miserable weather. \\n\\nWe all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We \\nhave found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish \\na letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to \\naddress the congregation, or include mention of the gift of \\nlife in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample \\nletter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.\\n\\nDR. STARZL TO BE HONORED \\n\\nThe Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will \\nhold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the \\nFountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas \\nStarzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and \\nare going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne \\nTreffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.\\n\\nMEMBERSHIP NEWS \\n\\nCongratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant \\nin Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing \\nwell after only 12 days in hospital.\\n\\nArthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston \\nMarathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation \\nworks!  We hope the national press notices. \\n     \\nBob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his \\ntransplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis \\nand feeling better.  \\n\\nNicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie, \\nspent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems \\nencountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.  \\nThey are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will \\ncontinue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery. \\n\\nKay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall \\nthat resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a \\ncandidate for the Board so we need her well soon.\\n \\nAnd best wishes to all coming out of the flu.

The only thing\\n>that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it.  Sure there is\\n>that little thing in the trigger but that isn't too great of a safety.\\n\\nYou're getting warmer.  The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be\\ndepressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned\\nthing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just\\nabout (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is\\nfunctioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working\\ncorrectly is totally drop safe.\\n\\nNow, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single\\ndocumented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because\\nhe failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few\\ndocumented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't\\nfigure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the\\nproprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely\\nprevented the office from getting shot.\\n\\nThe purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.\\nThis does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down\\nintentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a\\n'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the\\nstandpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else.\\nBy this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece.\\nFrom the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a\\nrevolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of\\nfiring it.\\n\\nThe ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that\\nthe firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the\\nwide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be\\nfamiliar with that particular type of firearm.\\n\\nRick.\\n\",\n",

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in\\naddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray\\nlevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to\\nformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial\\nproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a\\nparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4\\nbit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\\nthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\\nwould call Japan, etc.\\n\\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images\\nfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not\\nlike memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on\\ngetting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would\\ngreatly appreciate your sending it to me.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nAllan Weber\\nSignal & Image Processing Institute\\nUniversity of Southern California\\nweber@sipi.usc.edu\\n\",\n",

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for\\nother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy\\nand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were\\nkilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions \\nlying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,\\npeaceful solution.)

The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in\\nreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many\\npeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own\\nstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to\\nkill by their leaders.\\n\\nThe point is that there are many things involved in religion that often\\nlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \\n\\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\\nparts of Man's history.@\\n\\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\\nfurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these\\nwere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious\\npersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more\\npowerfull - is trying too hard.

So\\nthere\\'s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it\\'s worth, is that one sees both\\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \\n\\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don\\'t believe it is \\never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \\n\\n\\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\\n\\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \\nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \\n\\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what\\'s not  as it is a \\nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \\nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \\nobjectively convince others of the validity of one\\'s results is an\\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \\nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \\nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\\n\\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\\ninvestigation.  \\n\\nIn article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: \\n> Namely, is there really justification for the belief that\\n> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?  \\n\\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\\namount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I\\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \\nspecific question to try and answer.  \\n\\nThe \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \\ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \\nI certainly wasn\\'t thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \\nof \"reason and observation.\"\\n\\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \\n\\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \\nis any existing research related to this question.  \\n\\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \\n\\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\\n',\n",

The first HD is\\'nt\\nterminated\\n>the second will be.\\n>Whats about the power supply. Where can i connect a 3 1/2\" AMP-Connector\\n>to supply my 3 1/2\" HD?\\n\\nIt is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any\\nmacintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came\\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\\n \\nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\\nover two months.\\n\\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don\\'t have a spare\\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\\nshorts or bad connections.\\n\\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn\\'t word so what\\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn\\'t work, my original cable is not\\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\\n\\nHaving done all that, I couldn\\'t be bothered to check the dev notes for\\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\\nday. \\n\\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID\\'s of\\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\\n\\nPeter Hansen\\nBell Northern Research\\npgmoffc@BNR.ca\\n',\n",

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That\\nSpoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no\\nreference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of\\nresurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what\\nthe point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work \\n_Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ\\nCambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul\\nhere has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there\\nis no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared,\\nno ascension either.\\n\\nResurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the\\ngrave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts\\nuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up\\nwith a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly,\\nI think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts\\nbefore this which mention the tomb). \\n    \\n\\n> \\n> Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body.

Some of the misinformations were as follows:\\n\\n    - It was alleged that:\" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah\\'s technological\\n    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of\\n    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. \"!\\n    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives \\n    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology\\n    in Iran after revolution.\\n\\n    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors\\n    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen\\n    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in\\n    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and\\n    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.\\n\\n    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi\\n    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most\\n    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total\\n    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million\\n    dead left from the war.\\n\\n    - The translation of Iranian officials\\' talks are not 100% true. For\\n    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: \" It hurts me to\\n    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda.\" The \\n    translator says: \" It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly \\n    research.\"!\\n\\n    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought\\n    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to \\n    undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran\\'s\\n    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in\\n    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.\\n\\n    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of \\n    Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the\\n    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed\\n    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account\\n    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its\\n    potential role in improvement of Iran\\'s industries and eventually the\\n    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries\\n    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones\\n    in scientific and industrial efforts.\\n\\n    4- A key point in program\\'s justifications is trying to disvalidate as\\n    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from\\n    Iran\\'s different sites. They say: \"We are not sure if the places visited\\n    by IAEA are the real ones or not\" !, or \" We can not rely on IAEA\\'s\\n    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq\\'s nuclear\\n    activities before\" as if they didn\\'t know that Iraq was trying to build\\n    nuclear weapons!\\n\\n    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the\\n    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,\\n    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking\\n    from the absolute knowledge!\\n\\n       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their\\n    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to\\n    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs\\n    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.\\n\\n\\nMohammad\\n\\n  \\n    [*] International Atomic Energy Agency\\n  \\n',\n",

This\\ndoesn\\'t mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in\\nthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.\\n\\n  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should\\naddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like\\nit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,\\nand isn\\'t.  \\n  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has\\nforgotten.  This doesn\\'t mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we\\nhave something to learn from the pagan movement.\\n  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of\\noppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to\\nlive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ \\ncould have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great\\ndeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the \\nmale-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have\\nhad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.\\n  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great\\nramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings\\nand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long\\ntradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress\\nand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human\\nexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  \\nChristianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism\\nis an attractive option.\\n  I\\'m not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)\\nshould be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of\\nsexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated\\nsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\\n\\nAlan Terlep\\t\\t\\t\\t    \"Incestuous vituperousness\"\\nOakland University, Rochester, MI\\t\\t\\t\\natterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu\\t\\t\\t\\t   --Melissa Eggertsen\\nRushing in where angels fear to tread.\\t\\t\\n',\n",

Some magazines also provide the data on\\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\\ndata on computer disk.\\n\\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\\na \"bingo card\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\\n\\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \"23% of readers\\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors.\" And finally, some\\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC\\'s, in the past 6 months.\\n\\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the \"literature collectors\" from\\nthe serious potential customers.\\n\\n\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\"\\n\\nWhat\\'s the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\\n\\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\\n  weeks later.\\n\\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\\n  on a computer printout.\\n\\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you\\'re\\n  not really \"qualified\" for, send in a bingo card at least every\\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\\n\\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it\\'s your house.\\n  Advertisers almost never call. \\n\\nJohn Schuch\\n  publisher of: The Arizona High-Tech Times\\n                The Arizona Electrical Journal\\n                The Arizona HVAC News\\n  (all of which have bingo cards)\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The Shephard's Rod (now \\ndefunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.\\n\\nThe Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the \\nSDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they \\nwere the remnant spoken about in Revelation.\\n\\nAbout the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once \\nin control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as \\nChrist.\\n\\nKoresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young \\nadult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over \\nthe youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.\\n\\nThey were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of \\nweapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US \\ngovernment or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were \\nputting themselves in a self defense position.  \\n\\nIn my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn'\\nt have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.\\n\\nIf you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the \\nlocal SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you \\nsome insight into where Koresh got his theology.\\n\\nTammy\\n\",\n",

I\\nwould rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.\\n\\n2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an\\nimpressive win last week. NOw Otto\\'s latest debacle has restored Simmon\\'s\\nreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his \\'92 form when he had the\\nAL\\'s highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted\\'s sake), I hope he\\npitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.\\n\\n3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.\\nBUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have\\nshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little\\nbit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.\\nMerced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at\\nthe plate in his rookie year.\\n\\n4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that\\nWalk desrved his contract.\\n\\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\\ncan\\'t understand his and management\\'s fear of losing Tom Prince through\\nwaivers. Even if they do, what\\'s the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\\npitching). Didn\\'t Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to\\ntrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\\nwasn\\'t very fit last year.\\n\\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\\non Patterson in stead.\\n\\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn\\'t been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\\n\\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn\\'t given a contract extension last year? NOw his\\nvalue has increased immensely.\\n\\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\\nLet\\'s see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won\\'t be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\\n\\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon\\'s tenure was\\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\\n\\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\\nnothing else will.\\n\\nOn a final note. Tim Wakefield won\\'t be as awful as he was in his last 2\\nstarts. BUt don\\'t count on him pitching like last year for the rest of\\nthe season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the\\nseason, they will miss Redus\\'s clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked\\nin the second half of the last 2 seasons)>\\n\\n\\n-Pravin Ratnam\\n',\n",

Ahola had\\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it\\'s actually less; the San Jose\\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn\\'t been\\nspectacular, and his offense isn\\'t anything to write home about (8 points);\\nit\\'s even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\\nout to be ... Peter Ahola.\\n\\n#24\\tDOUG WILSON\\t\\tSeason: 16th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and\\n\\t\\t2nd round pick in \\'92 entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B)\\n\\nI have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high\\nexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.\\nNevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and\\nplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,\\nunfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to\\ncatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for\\n2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be\\nWilson\\'s last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\\n\\n#29\\tDEAN KOLSTAD\\t\\tSeason:\\t2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (C-/D+)\\n\\nIt\\'s probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he\\'s\\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\\n\\n#38\\tPAT MACLEOD\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\\nhe wouldn\\'t clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\\nSince he has played so little, I can\\'t even give a tentative grade on him, but\\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\\nskills.\\n\\n#41\\tTOM PEDERSON\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+)\\n\\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\\n43 games.  However, his size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\\n\\n#45\\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (D+/D)\\n\\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that\\nwill go down in Scremin\\'s entry of league stats is probably the fact that he\\nwas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\\n\\n===============================================================================\\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune \\n          juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from \\n          concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to \\n          your home bathroom.) \\n               4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and \\n          dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS \\n          CONTAIN LAETRILE.). \\n               5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from \\n          two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and \\n          add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).  \\n          Drink one glass per hour.\\n          [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day \\n          every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH \\n          PULP.] \\n               6th day: Same as 5th day. \\n               7th day: Same as 6th day. \\n               All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each \\n          day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, \\n          plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \\n\\n          (2) THE GRAPE DIET. \\n               Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to \\n          8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the \\n          six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \\n      \\n          (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.\\n               Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple \\n          cider \"flavored\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a \\n          glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.  \\n          Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a \\n          week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal \\n          healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially \\n          effective against those types of cancer that resemble a \\n          FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. \\n        \\n          (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]\\n               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level \\n          comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.  \\n          Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely \\n          dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt \\n          (regular salt won\\'t work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. \\n               Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising \\n          your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your \\n          stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, \\n          chomping your teeth together, etc.. \\n               Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes \\n          the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the \\n          book \"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\", by Frances Nixon, 1973. \\n               PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should \\n          prepare it and drain it.\\n          For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away \\n          from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly \\n          expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt \\n          other people\\'s fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at \\n          least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.  \\n          (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take \\n          a 2-Billion-bacteria \"Acidophilus\" capsule, which is also an \\n          EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \"A.I.D.S.\" \\n          (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the \\n          digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune \\n          system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal \\n          bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \"Lyme disease\".]\\n          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder \\n          storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \"Major\" or \\n          \"Minor Periods\" as listed in the \"Solunar Tables\" published \\n          bimonthly in \"Field & Stream\" Magazine, (because of the \\n          measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields \\n          present at those times).\\n          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. \\n       \\n          (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: \\n       \\n               For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the \\n               affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons \\n               per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for \\n               about 2 months. \\n        \\n               D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to \\n               perform NORMAL cell functions. \\n\\n               ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.  \\n               To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.  \\n               To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per \\n               day.\\n               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.  \\n               IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer \\n               cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile \\n               into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is \\n               ALSO present in the digestive system.)] \\n\\n               ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include \\n               Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most \\n               people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A \\n               (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide \\n               Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up \\n               to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-\\n               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime \\n               will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types), \\n               suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, \\n               prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not \\n               cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST \\n               \"A.I.D.S.\", which is really a form of cancer similar to \\n               leukemia.]  (See the book \"Life Extension\", by Durk \\n               Pearson and Sandy Shaw.) \\n\\n               HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% \\n               hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably \\n               DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day, \\n               hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.  \\n               Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers \\n               several times per day.\\n               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good \\n               daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants \\n               described above. \\n\\n               VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and \\n               much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA \\n               doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. \\n\\n               Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell) \\n               NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on \\n               and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an \\n               aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-\\n               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with \\n               daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH \\n               magnetic fields. \\n\\n               Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES \\n               can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well \\n               as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics \\n               Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos \\n               of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays! \\n\\n               INTERFERON tablets.\\n\\n               TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho). \\n           \\n               HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical \\n               problems (even drug addiction!). \\n\\n               50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure \\n               prostate trouble. \\n\\n               This list is NOT exhaustive. \\n\\n\\n          The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-\\n          DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent \\n          and cure many other medical problems including heart-\\n          diseases.

Where can I get patches to X11R5?\\n\\n\\tThe release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced\\nin the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.\\n\\n\\tPatches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other\\nsites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the \\nnewsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in \\ntheir source distributions of X11.\\n\\n\\tPeople without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has \\n23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line\\n\\t\\tsend fixes #\\nwhere # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.\\n\\n\\tHere are a few complications:\\n\\t1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request \"5a\", \"5b\", \"5c\" and \\n\"5d\" separately\\n\\t2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was \\nre-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn\\'t work with Solaris]\\n\\t3) fix 8 is in two parts: \"8a\" and \"8b\"\\n\\t4) fix 13 is in three parts: \"13a\", \"13b\", and \"13c\"\\n\\t5) fix 16 is in two parts: \"16a\" and \"16b\"\\n\\t6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which \\npreviously was optional\\n\\t7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff\\nby asking for \"PEXlib.uu.[1234]\".\\n\\t8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, \"22a\" through \"22i\"\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?\\n\\n\\tThe xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail \\nit a request, and it mails back the response.\\n\\tAny of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The\\nxstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can \\nhave several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). \\nThe xstuff server treats the \"Subject:\" header line just like any other line \\nof the message.\\n\\tThe archives are organized into a series of directories and \\nsubdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an \\nindex. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the \\nsubdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.\\n\\n\\t1) The command \"help\" or \"send help\" causes the server to send you a \\nmore detailed version of this help file.\\n\\t2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"index\", then \\nthe server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If\\nthere are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then \\nthe indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. \\nFor example, you can say \"send index fixes\" (or \"index fixes\"). A message that \\nrequests an index cannot request data.\\n\\t3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"send\", then the\\nxstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name \\nan item, you give its directory and its name. For example\\n                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9\\n\\tYou may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many \\nsafeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large \\namounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed\\namount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the \\nday\\'s quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. \\nWhenever the mailer is run to send its day\\'s quota, it sends the requests out \\nshortest-first.\\n\\t4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting \\nreturn addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won\\'t get any response.  If \\nyou happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like\\n        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu\\nor\\n        path bar!foo!frotz\\nin the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.\\n\\n\\tThe xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If \\nyour mailer deals in \"!\" notation, try sending to \\n{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.\\n\\n[based on information from the MIT X Consortium, 8/89, 4/90.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  60)!

First, in February, the Russians deployed a\\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this \"Banner\" reflector was blank,\\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\\ndeployed by the inflatable \\'frame\\'.\\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading\\nsensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\\'s\\ndelicate protective ozone layer,\" according to Mike Lawson, head of\\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\\'s\\natmosphere. According to IMI, \"as the biodegradable material burns,\\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\\nreplenish the ozone layer.\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor\\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\\nup and \"adds to the ozone supply.\"\\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \\'unit\\' cost\\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\\n  \\nBut back to Brian\\'s questions:\\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \"wild\\n>idea\" stage or does it have real funding?\\n  \\n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\\'t piggy back upon\\nsomeone else\\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\\nlaunch.  That\\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\\'t think the\\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\\nand no, I don\\'t really like the idea of this additional light\\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\\nidiot?)\\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\\'s in a low\\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\\'s the time\\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\\'t heard of any serious funding\\nfor this, but I\\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\\n  \\n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\\nmy guest.  I don\\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\\nI don\\'t THINK I do...).\\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor\\n\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\n',\n",

In 1985\\nthe New York Times reported that government investigators broke\\nup a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated\\nequipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to\\neavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest\\nthem.\\n     A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said \"There are a lot of\\nmedium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the\\nsignals intelligence operation of this group.\"\\n     For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who\\nhave the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure\\ncommunications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will\\nonly increase their numbers.\\n     Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the\\nuse of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional\\nand civil liberties questions involved.\\n     For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as\\nan investigative tool by the local \"law-enforcement\" people.  I\\nsuspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and\\nshortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the\\nconviction rate high.\\n     The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country\\n(even with a court order obtained by showing \"probable cause\") is\\nbecause we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and\\nwhat is ethically and morally right.\\n     I think that the same question of expediency versus morality\\nshould come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I\\nvote for morality.\\n     I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat\\nto prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is\\nnot put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White\\nHouse press release I came away with that impression.\\n     To most of the American public, the word \"hacker\" has\\nrightly or wrongly come to mean \"high tech adolescent vandal\".\\nIt has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt\\nregarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who\\nhave genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues\\nsurrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does\\nnot become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I\\nwould hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead\\nAct.\\n     The high speed digital communications revolution is coming\\nat us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing,\\nand just as IBM is learning that they can\\'t do business the same\\nway they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should\\nevaluate another approach.\\n     EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic\\nstrength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out\\nregarding the constitutional issues involved.\\n     Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.\\n     And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning: En quoi cela\\nvous concerne, cheri?\\n',\n",

Metzger)\\nSubject: The Escrow Database.\\nOrganization: Partnership for an America Free Drug\\nLines: 77\\n\\nHere is a disturbing thought.\\n\\nNow, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in\\nthe electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database\\nget? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were\\nI an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow\\nhouses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)\\n\\nWell, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of\\nserial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but\\nthis is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the\\npopulation, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for\\neach of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very\\nvaluable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who\\ncares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my\\npocket on two 8mm tapes.\\n\\nAdmittely, they will think of safeguards. They won\\'t put the whole\\ndatabase on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks\\nin the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day\\nby hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience\\nwill dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At\\nsome point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte\\ntapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will\\ndoubtless claim this can\\'t happen -- but we know that \"can\\'t\" is a\\nprayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.\\n\\nWith two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for\\nevery person\\'s conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you\\nneed the \"master key\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information\\nthat have to be stored an awful lot of places.\\n\\nCome to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database\\nisn\\'t a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial\\npolitical views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the\\nones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the\\nevil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have\\na big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial\\nsecrets, so he isn\\'t being completely irrational here (although why\\nour companies couldn\\'t use cryptosystems without back doors is left\\nunexplained by those that point out this threat.) \\n\\nPresumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA\\nand other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened\\nmany times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some\\nfraction of the keys. You can\\'t avoid that sort of thing.\\n\\nDon\\'t pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on\\nthe escrow databases.\\n\\nWe crypto types are all taught something very important at the\\nbeginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the\\neasily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a\\nsecret. The escrow databases aren\\'t the sorts of secrets that our\\nteachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they\\nwould lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million\\nClipper chips.\\n\\nI cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this\\ndoesn\\'t realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too\\nmany of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect\\nthat they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are\\ndoing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue\\nto surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect\\nthat they realize that they can\\'t put things off forever, but they can\\ntry to delay things as long as possible.\\n\\nWho knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable\\nbureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe\\nthat this scheme might give people some security, even as their\\nsubordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of\\nit all.\\n\\n--\\nPerry Metzger\\t\\tpmetzger@shearson.com\\n--\\nLaissez faire, laissez passer.

Should either of the two new \\nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \\n1994.\\n\\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \\n1995 draft in Winnipeg.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\\n \\n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50\\'s was made up of people who lived in \\nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \\nMontreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.\\n \\n Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?\\n A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to \\nsignify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer \\nexisted and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.\\n\\n Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?\\n A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans.

Short-\\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\\n \\n Q: What is the five-hole?\\n A: The space between a goalie\\'s pads. There are five major scoring zones: \\n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \\nright, and (5) five-hole.\\n \\n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950\\'s when two best-of-seven \\nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \\ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\\n\\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \\nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \\nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \\nBlues.

The Negev Bedouin Before and After 1948 II.     Jewish\\nAgricultural Settlement in the Negev III.   Development of the\\nNegev\\'s Rural Population IV.    Economic Situation of Jewish\\nSettlements in 1990 V.     Failure in Settling the Arava Valley\\nVI.   Failure in Settling the Central Mountains VII.  Failure in\\nMaking the Negev \"Bedouinenrein\" (Cleansing the Negev of Bedouins)\\nVIII. Transforming Bedouin into Low-Paid Workers IX..    Failure\\nin Settling the \"Development Towns\" X.      Jordan Water to the\\nNegev: A Strategic Asset XI.     The Negev Becomes a Dumping\\nGround XII.   The Dimona Nuclear Plant XIII.  The Negev as a\\nMilitary Base XIV.  The Negev in the Year 2000\\n\\nJust after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \"the\\nJewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\" was trumpeted\\nthroughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David\\nBen-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \"It\\'s by our\\npioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land\\ninto a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in\\nabandoned desert areas\".\\n\\nContrary to Ben-Gurion\\'s assertion, it must be affirmed that\\nduring the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for\\ncenturies previous, a productive human presence was to be found in\\nall parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys\\nof the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These\\nwere the Bedouin Arabs.\\n\\nThe real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern\\npart, occurred after Israel\\'s dispossession of the Bedouin\\'s\\ncultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the\\n12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the\\nState of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond\\nrecognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev\\nare the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief\\nrole is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture\\nlands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and\\ndumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli\\nJews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area\\ncultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish\\npastoral activity.\\n\\nI. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin\\nbefore and after 1948\\n-------------------------------------------------- In 1942,\\naccording to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba\\nsub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel\\'s Negev, or\\nSouthern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin\\nArabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep\\nand 22,000 goats.\\n\\nThe majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in\\nthe north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per\\nyear. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the\\nBeersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more\\nthan double the area cultivated by the Negev\\'s Jewish settlers\\nafter 40 years of \"making the desert bloom\"*\\n\\nThe Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of\\nbarley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming\\ntechniques were primitive, but production was based solely on\\nanimal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal\\nproduction, although low, was based entirely on pasturing.\\nProduction increased considerably during the rainy years and\\ndiminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture\\nanimals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight\\nquickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many\\nwaterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the\\nresult of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh\\nlocal conditions.\\n\\nAfter the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev\\nBedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The\\n10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of\\n40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150\\nmm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out\\nof three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,\\nspring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin\\nshepherds from roaming.\\n\\nA few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.\\nBut after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these\\nBedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure\\nwas applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields\\nin order that the land could be transferred to the army.\\n\\nNo reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held\\ntoday by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of\\nthe 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized\\nby the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now\\nconfined to seven \"development towns\", or *sowetos*, established\\nfor them.\\n\\n(the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email:\\nelias@ismennt.is)\\n\\n',\n",

Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I\\nwill also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.\\n\\n        The unit key \\n\\twill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \\n\\tand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \\n\\nThe unit key, also called the \"chip key,\" is generated from the\\nserial number N as follows.

Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.\\n(I\\'m unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that\\nthey\\'re called seeds suggests they might.)

Otherwise you\\'ll have\\n    to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string\\n    instead of using convenient octal sequences.]\\n\\n    If you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show\\n    your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you\\'ll\\n    have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out\\n    the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.\\n    Sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence\\n    in the prompt string itself, sometimes not ...\\n\\n\\n+-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+\\n| Mark Lanzo   KD4QLZ  lanzo@tekelec.com   919-460-5576 |    \\\\\\\\\\\\///       |\\n+-------------------------------------------------------+---- \\\\XX/ -------+\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n',\n",

Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \\nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \\nPackard Scanners.  \\n\\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \\n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \\nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \\n\\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \\nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\\n\\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \\nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \\nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \\nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn\\'t think it converted \\ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \\ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \\nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \\ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \\nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \\n\\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \\nprocessor formats.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \\nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \\nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \\nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \\nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \\nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \\ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \\nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \\nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \\ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \\nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \\nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \\nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \\neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \\n(3). \\n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \\nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \\nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \\npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \\nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \\n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \\nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \\nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \\ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \\npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \\nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \\n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \\n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \\nwas initiated. \\n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \\nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \\ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \\n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \\nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \\nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \\nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \\na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \\nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \\ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \\n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \\n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \\nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \\n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \\nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \\n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \\n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \\nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \\nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \\nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \\nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \\nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \\nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \\n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \\npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \\nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \\n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \\noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \\npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \\nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \\nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \\ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \\nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \\nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \\nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \\n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \\nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \\nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \\ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \\ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \\nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \\nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \\nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \\nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \\none patient 38 days after illness onset. \\n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \\nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \\n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \\nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \\nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \\nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \\n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \\nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \\n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \\nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \\nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \\nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \\n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \\n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \\nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \\nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \\nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \\nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \\n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \\nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \\n\\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \\nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \\nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \\nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \\nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children\\'s Hospital and \\nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \\nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \\nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \\ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \\nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \\nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \\nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \\nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \\nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \\nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \\nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \\n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \\nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \\nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \\n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \\nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \\ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \\ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \\nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \\n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \\noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \\nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \\nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \\n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \\npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \\nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \\nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \\nhealth action to prevent further cases. \\n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \\ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \\nDepartment of Agriculture\\'s Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \\ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \\nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \\nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \\npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \\nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \\ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \\nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \\nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \\nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \\nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \\n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \\n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \\nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \\nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \\noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \\nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \\ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \\ncoli O157:H7. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Long-term use of \\nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \\noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \\ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \\nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \\nCDC\\'s 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \\nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \\ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \\nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \\nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \\n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \\ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \\nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \\nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \\nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \\ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \\nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \\ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \\nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \\nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \\nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \\nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \\nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \\nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \\nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \\nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \\n(3). \\n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \\nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \\nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \\nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \\nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \\nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \\nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \\nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \\nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \\nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \\nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \\n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \\naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \\nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \\nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \\namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \\n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \\nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \\nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \\naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \\n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \\nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \\nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \\n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \\n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \\ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \\nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \\nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \\n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \\n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\\n49.6). \\n\\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \\nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \\nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \\ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \\nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \\nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \\nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \\nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \\nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \\n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \\nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \\nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \\nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \\nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \\ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \\n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \\nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \\nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \\nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \\nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \\nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \\nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \\nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \\n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \\npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \\ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \\n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \\nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \\nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \\ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \\nenforcing laws that restrict minors\\' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \\ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \\nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \\nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \\ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

What\\'s up?\\n| \\n| This is a frequently asked question.  Every time it arises, it causes\\n| months of debate.  So let me see if I can answer you directly.\\n| Basically it\\'s because the Law was given to Moses as part of a\\n| specific covenanent with the Jews.  Most of us aren\\'t Jews, so we\\n| aren\\'t part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in\\n| Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to\\n| Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this\\n| debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but\\n| keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles\\n| concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians,\\n| and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.\\n\\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\\n\\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\\n\\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\\n\\n4.  Israel stands for God\\'s people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ\\'s, then are ye\\nAbraham\\'s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\\nAbraham\\'s seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\\n\\n| \\n| While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us,\\n| because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews,\\n| we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected\\n| from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, it\\'s the\\n| same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this.\\n| \\n| These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments\\n| into \"moral\" and \"ceremonial\".  Ceremonial commandments apply only to\\n| the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are\\n| thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to\\n| everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except\\n| for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take\\n| this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on\\n| the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to\\n| worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians\\n| are free to choose the specific time we worship.\\n\\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\\n| \\n| A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin\\n| and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer\\n| binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior\\n| should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still\\n| useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally\\n| binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not\\n| believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While\\n| we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, it\\'s not safe for us to go\\n| into situations with no principles to guide us.  We\\'re too good at\\n| self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral\\n| guidance, from things like Jesus\\' teachings, Paul\\'s advice, etc.\\n| These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same\\n| function as, and have largely the same content as, the \"moral law\" in\\n| the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed\\n| legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that\\n| given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important.\\n| \\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\\n\\n| In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of\\n| tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ\\'s\\n| resurrection.  There\\'s some debate about what Acts shows about early\\n| Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish\\n| Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but\\n| that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then.\\n| Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (Sunday), and I Cor 16:2 also\\n| implies gatherings on that day.\\n| \\n| There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to\\n| worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day\\n| Adventists and Jehovah\\'s Witnesses.  They argue that Act 20:7 is not a\\n| regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and\\n| that I Cor 16:2 doesn\\'t explicitly say it\\'s a regular worship service.\\n\\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\\n| \\n| It\\'s clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul\\'s time.  See\\n| Rom 14:5.  Paul\\'s advice is that we should be very careful about\\n| judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific\\n| day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that\\n| specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his\\n| worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the\\n| Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue\\n| that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col\\n| 2:16, which says something similar but briefer.  It explicitly\\n| mentions Sabbath.)\\n\\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\\nday of the moral law.\\n| \\n| There are some differences among Christians about use of the word\\n| \"Sabbath\".  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish\\n| day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the\\n| day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply\\n| the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering\\n| schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It\\n| distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated\\n| for Jews, and the Lord\\'s Day -- which is the free Christian worship.\\n| (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10.)  There\\n| are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians\\n| support \"blue laws\", both in secular law and church law, setting aside\\n| that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical\\n| anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish\\n| Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the\\n| Lord\\'s Day.\\n| \\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\\nmake false gods, to violate God\\'s name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\\n\\nDarius\\n\\n[It\\'s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\\nthink Paul\\'s comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\\n\\nHowever I\\'d like to be clear that I do not think there\\'s unambiguous\\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\\n\\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \\n\\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t tell us\\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius\\'\\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn\\'t say they gathered to\\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that\\'s just not explicit\\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul\\'s\\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can\\'t disprove it,\\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \\n\\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\\nworship was.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for\\n many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size\\n and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard\\n x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,\\n bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)\\n may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different\\n line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of\\n distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in\\n the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek\\n alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts\\n can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device\\n drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile\\n format and renderer.\\n\\n The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.\\n The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly\\n granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without\\n consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT\\n object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it\\n is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely\\n available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed\\n somewhere in the documentation for the package.\\n\\n We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of\\n user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any\\n published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,\\n which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that\\n as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the\\n kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest\\n in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only\\n afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on\\n those which help us get our work done.\\n\\n PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically\\n without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub\\n routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any\\n modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the\\n header file \"plplot.h\"; see the documentation for more details.\\n\\n The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of\\n several TeX files; please consult this for additional information (\\'latex\\n plotdoc\\').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to\\n the code, so don\\'t be surprised if some known features are not explained\\n there.  Consult \\'Changes.log\\' to see a list of recent changes.  \\n\\n At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\\n\\n\\t Unix:\\tSunOS\\n\\t\\t A/IX \\n\\t\\t HP-UX\\n\\t\\t Unicos\\n\\t\\t DG/UX\\n\\t\\t Ultrix\\n\\t\\t SysV\\n\\t\\t Linux\\n\\n\\t Amiga/Exec\\n\\t MS-DOS\\n\\t OS/2\\n\\t NeXT\\n\\n For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:\\n  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual\\n  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.\\n\\n To become a subscriber to the PLPLOT mailing list, send a request to\\n plplot-request@dino.ph.utexas.edu.\\n\\n CREDITS\\n -------\\n\\n PLPLOT is the result of the effort of many people, so it is impractical to\\n list all the contributors.

Last year at the\\nliturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins, so\\ntherefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd, but\\nto no avail.\\n\\n>musicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the\\n>liturgy and since no one knows what\\'s happening, the new things have to be\\n>explained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we\\'re just\\n>sitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about\\n>to be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\\n>\"experts\", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a\\n>bias toward doing something rather than nothing--that\\'s just a fact of\\n>bureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for\\n>people to be aware of the Lord\\'s presence.\\n\\n   As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem\\nis certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of\\ninnovations.  The priests don\\'t seem even to _want_ to make any\\ndecisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it\\'s easier to \"try\\nsomething new\" than it is to refuse to allow it.\\n\\n   At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet\\n(\"Who wants to get around people\\'s feet,\" according to one of our\\npriests) the congregation was \"invited\" to come up and help wash one\\nanother\\'s hands.\\n\\n   The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to\\nparticipate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with\\nrubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. \"Body of Christ\" -- \"Amen\"\\nfor receiving Communion), that they could be \"I am not responsible for\\nthe blood of this man.\"\\n\\n   Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer (\"Blessed are You, God of\\nall creation...\") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The\\npriest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to\\nothers, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion\\nthat night (we aren\\'t required to anyway -- I instead offered up\\nprayers for our priests and parish).\\n\\n>So we\\'ve been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\\n>going down?  I don\\'t mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or\\n>Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware \\n>of God\\'s presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should \\n>just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational\\n>participation in Catholic Masses lately?\\n\\n   The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to be\\ncelebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would\\nstill be \"liturgically\" beautiful.  The problem comes about from\\npeople trying to be \"creative\" who are not.\\n\\n   I think the answer to your question on participation could be that\\ngiven by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed by\\nthe title of Thomas Day\\'s _Why Catholics Can\\'t Sing_.  \"They don\\'t\\nwant to\" because of all this nonsense.\\n\\n   By the way, for any non-Catholics reading this, the problem does\\nnot reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church, but by those who are\\ndisobedient to the Church in changing it on their own \"authority.\"\\n\\n-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\nSteve Creps, Indiana University\\ncreps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu\\n',\n",

Space Science\\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\\ngenerate interest in the project. I\\'ll typein the handout he gave out at\\nthe meeting. Here goes : \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\\n\\t\\t\\t-------------------------\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\\n\\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a \\'conventional\\' type\\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\\n\\n2.Design\\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\\n\\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\n3.Missions\\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\\nrate.\\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\\nbase, BTW]\\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\\nnucleus.

This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and\\ncordless phones.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nReading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure\\nwithout access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses\\nconfronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese\\nsecurity services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make\\navailable some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.\\n\\nMost legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to\\nhave a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of\\ndepositing keys in escrow.

Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the\\nweek, and that system has worked pretty well.\\n\\nFrom my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that\\nneed to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in\\nreturn we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES\\nand other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly\\nskilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be\\nchecked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn\\'t have to\\nbe, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys\\npursuant to a legitimate court order.

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\\n   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme\\n   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\\n   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\\n   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...\\n\\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\\n\\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company\\'s\\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\\nwhich came first, the plaintiff\\'s acquisition of the land or he\\ndefendant\\'s start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\\nplaintiffs\\' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\\n\\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\\n\\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs\\' request for an injunction, the court\\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\\nalways problematical even when it\\'s done by the state; allowing a\\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\\n\\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn\\'t call it eminent domain.  But if\\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\\nlike eminent domain...)\\n\\nLet me take issue with the way you\\'ve presented the case... you say that\\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn\\'t allow the\\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\\n\\n    (Pulls out Black\\'s Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\\n    extortion statutes.\")\\n\\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party\\'s act of demanding the right\\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\\nthey wanted.  There isn\\'t, or at least shouldn\\'t be, any law that says\\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\\n\\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\\nplaintiff\\'s lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\\n\\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn\\'t want to have to face a choice\\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\\nshouldn\\'t Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\\n\\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone\\'s property rights were protected; the\\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\\n(If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\\n\\n> Is _Boomer_ really being taught as \"infamous?\"  That\\'s really sad if\\n> it is, because I fail to see how it\\'s less than completely sensible.\\n> You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of\\n> filtered through teachers who clearly don\\'t like it, for whatever\\n> inexplicable reasons.\\n\\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\\nschool.\\n\\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\\n\\nI called it infamous because that\\'s my opinion of it.  For the reasons\\nI\\'ve stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\\n\\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\\'s wrongful acts.\\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\\nother people\\'s property by eminent domain.)\\n\\n> You\\'d like Posner, Bill.  He\\'s a libertarian.\\n\\nReally?

Automatic setups are fine for simple,\\nrepetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more\\ncomplex events where you need to understand how the scope is\\nactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope\\nin \"equivalent time\" or in \"real time\" sampling mode (equivalent time\\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope\\'s actual sampling\\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\\n\\nIs the HP scope you\\'re using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\\n\\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\\nof the scope.

The world now has almost 10\\n  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of\\n  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as\\n  dramatically.\\n\\n    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial\\n  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy\\n  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group\\n  of Seven nations.\\n\\n    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil\\n  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the\\n  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,\\n  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the\\n  overall U.S. economy.\\n\\n    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per\\n  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.\\n\\n    Utilities\\' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side\\n  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource\\n  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not\\n  reduce demand.\\n\\n    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes\\n  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that\\n  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,\\n  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood\\n  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state\\n  at the expense of the individual.\\n\\n    \"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\" is no.\\n  189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an\\n  independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.\\n\\n\\n\\nAvailable from:\\n  Cato Institute\\n  224 Second Street SE\\n  Washington, DC  20003\\n\\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        The Cato Institute\\n\\n    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research\\n  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate\\n  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the\\n  traditional American principles of limited government, individual\\n  liberty, and peace.

We\\'ll be riding some twisty, \\n   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).\\n\\nCommunication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler\\nback every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled\\nMagna, we can hear each other.  It\\'s only above, say, 45 MPH that you \\ncan\\'t really communicate.\\n\\nBalance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how\\nthey\\'re going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately\\nand lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning\\nthing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a\\npain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay\\nperpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn\\nand WHIP AROUND until they\\'re in the `correct\\' position.  This always\\nscrews up the line I\\'ve picked out.\\n\\nHere\\'s my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:\\n\\t- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.\\n\\t- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not\\n\\t  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I\\'ve had people try to dismount\\n\\t  in traffic, just as I\\'m pulling in to a parking space!)\\n\\t- Muffler gets HOT! (\\'Nuff said)\\n\\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We\\'re not going to fall over.  (Many\\n\\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\\n\\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you\\'re sitting upright and\\n\\t  we\\'re going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you\\'re\\n\\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\\n\\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \\n\\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \\n\\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\\n\\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\\n\\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \\n\\t  thing -- I\\'ve driven many miles on this thing, and know how\\n\\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\\n\\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \\n\\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \\n\\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she\\'d holler, \"SLOW DOWN! I\\'M SCARED\" \\n\\t  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with \\n\\t  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.\\n\\t  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the\\n\\t  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her\\n\\t  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to \\n\\t  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)\\n\\nUsually I\\'ll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, \\ntires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.\\nHelps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.\\n\\nWatch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little\\nmudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will\\nbe nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.\\nIt doesn\\'t help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the \\nfirst trip!\\n\\nGood luck -- have fun!\\n--\\nDON\\'T DRINK SOAP!

[1]\\n\\nBorn 1964\\nSecretary-Typist\\nAzsantekmontazh Trust\\nSumgait Construction and Installation Administration\\nSecretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization\\n\\nResident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15\\nMicrodistrict No. 3\\nSumgait [Azerbaijan]\\n\\n\\nOn the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o\\'clock show,\\nat the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards \\naway. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" \\nBefore the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \\nthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there\\'s no conversation \\nwhatsoever, and we couldn\\'t figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \\nwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \\nsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn\\'t know. We bought our tickets. There \\nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \\nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \\nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \\nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \\nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \\nto Armenian girls. I thought that\\'s what they meant because they had demanded \\na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \\nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \\nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \\nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it\\'s\\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \\nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \\npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \\nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \\ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we\\'ve \\nscared them enough, let\\'s leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \\nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \\n\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \\nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \\nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \\nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \\ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \\nand it was dark . . .\\n\\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that\\'s the center of town. Lenin\\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \\nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren\\'t especially \\nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn\\'t know if we were going to \\nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \\nwasn\\'t running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \\npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \\nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \\nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \\nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \\nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \\nlive literally one stop away. We didn\\'t want to go on foot, not because it was\\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \\ndriver didn\\'t want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \\nhe said he\\'d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \\nOK . . .\\n\\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \\nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \\nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they\\'re not going \\nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what\\'s going on, and there\\'s\\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \\ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that\\'s it . . . Somehow we managed to \\ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \\ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \\nnothing had happened.\\n\\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn\\'t go anywhere and \\ndidn\\'t call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn\\'t\\nguess.\\n\\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \\nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \\nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \\nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\\nhome and didn\\'t know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \\nZimogliad, came by at around three o\\'clock I think. We worked together, we did\\nour apprenticeships together, she\\'s a Russian girl. She said that something\\nawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don\\'t they want Armenians? Well what \\nare they after, if they\\'re already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \\nthat, it\\'s just a demonstration, but it\\'s awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \\ncabs, the buses, well it\\'s just a nightmare.\\n\\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \\nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\\nasked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\\non in the courtyard; aren\\'t you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn\\'t know what she\\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \\nand told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\\nthat something is really going on.\" But we didn\\'t go see her, she\\'s a Russian,\\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o\\'clock I \\ntell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it\\'s time for you to go, it\\'s late already, I\\'ll see \\nyou out.\" Mamma says, \"You don\\'t need to go, it\\'s too late already, you can \\nsee what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \\nready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \\ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \\nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we\\'re eating.\\nWe turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \\nWe cleared the table.\\n\\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can\\'t \\nsee what\\'s going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \\n. . . I can\\'t figure out what\\'s happening. They\\'re shouting something, looking\\nsomewhere, I can\\'t make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she\\'s \\nan Azerbaijani; we\\'ve been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \\nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \\npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \\nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\\nthat means it\\'s not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they\\'re not \\nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \\nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \\nfeet, everyone\\'s kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \\ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can\\'t speak\\n. . . Well, they\\'ve probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn\\'t see if he\\ngot up and left or not.\\n\\nI become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don\\'t go anywhere, stay at our\\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \\nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \\nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \\nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \\nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \\nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \\nkept them from coming in. There\\'s only one entryway there, they could stop \\nthem.\\n\\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \\nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \\nand it\\'s packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don\\'t \\ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It\\'s just a huge\\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \\nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \\ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \\ndin and roar. It\\'s incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \\nshouting Father\\'s name, \"Grisha, open the door, we\\'ve come to kill you!,\" or\\nsomething like that. I don\\'t remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \\nsays, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \\nof our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won\\'t come in there, \\nthey\\'ll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We\\'ll tell them \\nthat we live alone here.\" I can\\'t imagine that my parents will stand out in \\nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \\nthat I\\'ll stand together with them, I\\'ll talk with them if they come, maybe I \\ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \\nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can\\'t remember if I told \\nher anything or not.\\n\\nThen . . . they open the door: it\\'s like they blew on it and it broke and fell\\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\\ntell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\\nhas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \\nsay, \"OK. Go downstairs. We\\'ll gather everything we need and leave the \\napartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\\ndoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\\nToo bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \\ncommanding them: \"Don\\'t you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\\n\\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \\nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \\nin front of Mamma. I don\\'t remember where they went, what they did, or how \\nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don\\'t even know what I said. The \\natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \\nthemselves who would go first.\\n\\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don\\'t know if I\\'m dead or alive. Someone comes\\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \\nHe looks around at what\\'s happening. At that instant everything stops. It \\nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\\ndepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we\\'re done here.\" They are beating\\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \\n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she\\'s dead. Papa . . . was\\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can\\'t get the \\nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \\nwindows can\\'t be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \\nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She\\'s not a real strong \\nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I\\'m saying something, that\\nI\\'m still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \\nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \\ndon\\'t get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I\\'m dead, why would I \\nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that\\'s what I think, since my\\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \\n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\\n\\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don\\'t \\nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \\nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \\nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\\nelse is pinching me . . .I don\\'t even know. I think, my God, when will death \\ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \\nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don\\'t remember.\\n \\nI come to after a while, I don\\'t remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \\nclothing. I\\'m entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \\nthat I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \\nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can\\'t make \\nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \\nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \\ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors\\', even though \\nhe\\'s small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \\nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\\nthere, I think; now he\\'s stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \\nbrought me to the neighbors\\', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \\n\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I\\'m not one of them.\" How do I know who\\'s who \\nand what\\'s what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \\nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \\nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we\\'ll let you go, we aren\\'t touching the\\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she\\'s going \\nto tell them she\\'s Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina\\'s and Lyuda\\'s \\nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \\nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor\\'s and starts pounding \\non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \\nthere. So they survived.\\n\\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \\nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \\nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \\nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor\\'s on the fourth floor, the\\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \\nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I\\'m not going to let you \\nin the apartment because I\\'m afraid of them. But I\\'ll give you some stockings \\nand we\\'ll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I\\'ll stay at your place because of\\nwhat\\'s going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \\nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn\\'t consent. Lyuda came \\nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\\n\\nI came to. Mother was there. I can\\'t remember my supervisor\\'s telephone \\nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \\ncame to get us. He didn\\'t have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \\nsimply afraid, he didn\\'t know that they were killing us and that we had passed\\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \\nit was hard to breathe . . .\\n\\nMy supervisor\\'s name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He\\'s the head of our \\nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \\npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \\nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \\ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \\nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \\nwithout stopping. After us.\\n\\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\\nfrom Building 16, that\\'s the building in front of ours. There young \\nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn\\'t let it into their building. \\nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors\\', Marina called our relatives\\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \\nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\\nquickly, I can\\'t explain what\\'s going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis\\', ones who won\\'t give you away.\" At that moment \\nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \\nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \\nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \\nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \\nhere, haven\\'t you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \\nthe soldiers said, \"Don\\'t scream at us. We\\'re Muslims, but we\\'re not from the \\nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \\nDaghestan police were there.\\n\\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don\\'t know,\\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \\ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don\\'t know what they \\nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \\nand me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don\\'t \\nknow what to do with the rest.\"\\n\\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \\nboss said, \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\\nwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \\nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \\nambulances hadn\\'t done anything, they didn\\'t respond to any calls. People \\ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\\n\\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \\n\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \\nsays, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don\\'t know what your people have been\\ndoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \\nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don\\'t I just die so as not to\\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \\ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn\\'t \\nhave the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \\nthink of something that yours haven\\'t already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \\nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \\nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn\\'t do anything to help us. This\\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn\\'t do anything \\nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn\\'t want any shots or tranquilizer, \\nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn\\'t even want to look at \\nthem.\\n\\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \\nyour brother what happened, there\\'s no point in asking me, your brother can \\nbetter explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \\nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\\nward.\\n\\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \\nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \\nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \\nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can\\'t believe you put on such a\\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \\nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \\nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \\ncouldn\\'t take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\\nthat I couldn\\'t take the apples, and really didn\\'t have any appetite. No one \\nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \\nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \\nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \\nArmenian, maybe they wouldn\\'t figure it out from looking at me. So they must \\nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \\nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\\nthe street, I don\\'t know. In any case, I didn\\'t sleep a wink that night.\\n\\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \\nand off we went. I didn\\'t even know where they were taking me. They took me to\\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \\ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \\na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \\nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \\nafter that night. I still didn\\'t know what happened to my parents, they didn\\'t \\ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \\nI didn\\'t know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \\nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \\na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \\nother and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \\nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \\ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \\ncould. Of course I\\'m most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \\nwho didn\\'t lose his presence of mind and who didn\\'t change his opinions, \\nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \\nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \\n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \\nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \\nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\\nmyself I couldn\\'t get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \\nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \\nfrom all the blows, I don\\'t know. They didn\\'t diagnose anything in particular.\\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \\ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \\nThere was no way something inside wasn\\'t broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \\nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \\nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina\\'s \\nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children\\'s Clinic. \\nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\\nbreathing, I couldn\\'t seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\\nwasn\\'t cut.\\n\\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \\nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \\ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \\ndemand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It\\'s Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \\nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \\n\"We\\'ll only see Seidov\\'s daughter, have her come here, we\\'ll do the same \\nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we\\'ll deal with you \\nagitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \\nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \\nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \\nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \\nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \\nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \\nclub that didn\\'t even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \\nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \\nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \\ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn\\'t sit or lie down, it \\nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \\ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \\nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \\nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \\nright and left. I just don\\'t know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \\nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \\nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \\nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \\ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \\ntheater and there wouldn\\'t be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \\nthe attic. I didn\\'t see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \\ncouldn\\'t get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \\nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn\\'t. I was in no condition to open my \\neyes.\\n\\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren\\'t you an \\nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you\\'re an Azerbaijani.\" They\\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \\nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\\nthey should have, with their IDs.\\n\\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn\\'t \\nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \\nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \\nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \\nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn\\'t take her in, so she ran about the \\nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \\nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \\nalready in the city.\\n\\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \\nfamilies. They say they didn\\'t even know for sure if the people were Armenians\\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I\\'m not sure myself, I didn\\'t \\nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it\\'s very difficult \\nnow to say exactly who died and who didn\\'t. It was very difficult to identify \\nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\\ngasoline and burned . . . it\\'s all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \\nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \\nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\\nMicrodistrict 3.\\n\\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \\nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \\ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \\nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \\nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \\nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn\\'t see it myself, but I heard that they\\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \\nthe corpses, well you can\\'t call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \\nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\\nG., if I\\'m not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \\nshe still can\\'t figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \\nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \\nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \\ncarried her to the city. I still can\\'t imagine how he managed to do that.\\n\\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \\npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \\nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \\nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \\nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \\ncouldn\\'t find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone\\'s apartment and\\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\\nshe couldn\\'t remember anyone\\'s face.\\n\\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \\ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\\nout of my head. I can\\'t remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\\nthe Secretary of the Directorate\\'s Party organization, where Marina works. She\\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I\\'m the \\nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \\nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \\nmeetings. I know them all, I\\'ve even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \\nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\\n\\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they\\'re working on our\\ncase, but I can\\'t even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\\nthe ones, they\\'re processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \\ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \\nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \\npeople, all of them, as much as I\\'ve heard about them and seen them, they were\\nall from Kafan.\\n\\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \\nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn\\'t \\nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\\nI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \\nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn\\'t see Marina \\nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn\\'t make out \\nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \\nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \\nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \\nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \\nwe\\'re part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\\nhe\\'s here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \\nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I\\'m crazy, not \\nresponsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \\nmyself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \\nagain and says something entirely different: \"I wasn\\'t at home, my family and \\nI went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\\ndifferent before.\" After that I didn\\'t go to see our Procurator, our case is \\nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \\nthat Rzayev\\'s case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \\nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \\nhead I can\\'t say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \\ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn\\'t have to pay for it, but at the \\nsame time\\n\\nI\\'m afraid to say I\\'m a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you\\'re wrong, he didn\\'t do that, that one\\nwasn\\'t there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\\nexactly I can\\'t say.                                                     \\n\\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn\\'t see it, \\nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \\nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \\nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \\nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \\nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \\ndormitory is over there, that\\'s where he lives. Now he\\'s in custody, they even\\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \\nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\\n\\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn\\'t come \\nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \\nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \\ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \\nthey\\'ve caught him, everything\\'s been proved. Now, evidently, they\\'ve been\\nbeating him, I don\\'t know what they\\'re doing with them over there, but he \\nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \\ncame to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \\nbus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \\nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \\nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I\\'m going to go. But they didn\\'t\\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \\nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \\nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \\nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \\nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\\n\\nI\\'ve participated in the investigation a couple of times. I\\'m satisfied with\\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \\nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \\nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don\\'t know. \\nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \\nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \\nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \\nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \\nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \\ncurfew, and I\\'ve got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \\nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \\nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \\nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don\\'t know what he did, \\nI can\\'t remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \\nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there\\'s no need for this, \\nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you\\'re like a sister to me. I took a look\\nat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \\nyou.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \\nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \\nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \\nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \\nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \\nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \\nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \\napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I\\'ve got three kids and \\nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn\\'t have \\nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \\napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \\napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That\\'s what they said. How did they \\nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \\nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \\nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn\\'t set fire to our \\napartment.\\n\\nI don\\'t know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \\nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \\nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \\nsaw all of it, how could it happen?\" They\\'re asking me! Well I just don\\'t know\\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \\nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn\\'t have been \\nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \\nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \\nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \\nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \\ncame down to the entryway and said, \"You\\'ll come in this entryway over my dead\\nbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \\nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn\\'t \\neven know what they were doing. I don\\'t think that\\'s true. They knew very well\\nwhat they were doing if they didn\\'t even lift a hand against that woman. They \\ncouldn\\'t have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \\nstopped them.\\n\\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \\nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \\napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \\nMaybe I\\'m losing my mind? But no, they\\'re all chewing something. Maybe it is \\nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \\nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \\ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\\ndidn\\'t talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \\nscreamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we\\'re killing the Armenians!\" \\nOnly they didn\\'t shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \\nliterally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s how it was! I\\'ll continue. We hid in a captain\\'s apartment, he\\'s an\\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \\nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \\nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn\\'t find\\nLyuda she took Papa\\'s hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\\nbut they didn\\'t pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\\ncourage to . . .\\n\\nA boy said to my mother \"Where\\'s the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \\nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \\nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \\nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \\nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \\nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn\\'t really like to \\nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \\nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \\nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \\nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \\nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \\ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \\ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \\nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \\nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \\naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \\n\"What\\'s happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \\nfind out what\\'s happening to my daughters, even if they\\'ve burned them or \\nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \\nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \\nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn\\'t get out \\nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \\nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \\nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \\nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\\nher mind. I\\'ll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \\nway to me, I\\'ll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \\ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don\\'t remember what order it\\nhappened in.\\n\\nAnd Mamma said, \"Listen, they\\'re all running around down there, shouting \\nsomething or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \\nless calmed down where we were. Who\\'s dead, who\\'s alive, we don\\'t know. I \\ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\\nlet\\'s go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don\\'t know how \\nlong we\\'ll be here. Maybe they didn\\'t burn everything.\" I don\\'t get it, all\\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \\nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \\nfor? To hell with it! We\\'re alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\\nsays, \"No, let\\'s go get at least something. Maybe we\\'ll leave here, spend the \\nnight at someone else\\'s.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \\ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \\nshouts, \"Come back, they\\'re coming!\" They didn\\'t have enough time to get a \\nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \\nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father\\'s old coveralls. The neighbor, his \\nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \\nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \\nthey\\'re dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \\nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \\nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \\nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\\n\\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\\nAsya Dallakian. She\\'s an old woman, retired. She wasn\\'t at home, at that\\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \\nsomething like that, she\\'s a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \\nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \\nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \\nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \\nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \\nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren\\'t afraid, the ones who \\nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn\\'t know, but \\nthey didn\\'t come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \\nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \\napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He\\'s an exserviceman, retired, works up \\nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\\nThey tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don\\'t worry, we won\\'t harm you, you\\'re one of\\nus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren\\'t you taking anything from this \\napartment?\" He says, \"I don\\'t need anything.\" And the women who were standing \\nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \\nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \\nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \\nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \\npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \\nmad, and he says, \"Where\\'s the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \\n\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\\ndirection.\\n\\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \\nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \\njust didn\\'t tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \\nshe didn\\'t want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \\nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \\nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where\\'s the girl who was here?\"\\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn\\'t\\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\\ncame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \\nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \\nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \\nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \\nto get me. Then one of them said, \"There\\'s so much water down there, she \\nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \\nthe basement. That\\'s it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn\\'t know that, and \\nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn\\'t \\njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\\n\\nAfter that we of course didn\\'t want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \\ndidn\\'t want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \\nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \\nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \\nwho sat in their apartments and didn\\'t help us at a time like that. I think \\nthat they could have helped! I don\\'t think that they were obligated to, but \\nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \\nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you\\'re doing?\" That\\'s \\nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \\none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \\nstanding on their balconies I didn\\'t hear anyone\\'s voice, no one said what are\\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \\nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \\none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \\nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \\nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \\nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\\nyou want to go on living, you\\'ll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\\nThat trick didn\\'t work on them.\\n\\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \\nthat it happened. I said I\\'d only forget it if I told them right then that it\\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn\\'t have any effect on them, \\nthen I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \\nAnd no one did anything.

Dr. Noordewier has \\nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \\nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \\nto his current work in computational biology.\\n\\n12:00-2:45pm \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \\n Biologists\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\\n\\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \\npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \\napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \\nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \\nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \\nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \\naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \\nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \\nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \\nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \\nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \\n in Biological Sequence Analysis\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \\n National Laboratory) \\n\\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \\nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \\nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \\ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \\nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \\ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \\napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \\nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \\nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \\ntechniques in this domain.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\" \\n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\\n\\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \\nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \\ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \\nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \\ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \\nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \\nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \\nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \\nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \\nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \\na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \\nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \\nthe field.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\" \\n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \\n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\\n\\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \\nare increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of \\ntools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic \\npattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of \\ngenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the \\nidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes \\nin sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and \\nfunctional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty \\nappointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, \\nrepresents the branch of this field that considers higher-order \\nsyntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski \\nhas studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area \\nof word-based analyses.\\n\\n                      REGISTRATION FORM\\nMail, with check made out to \"ISMB-93\", to:\\n\\n               ISMB Conference, c/o J.

Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz.  These numbers sound \\nlike some you have herd before?   Thats right, you guessed it, they are \\ncommon IF numbers.

Now the\\nproto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and \"the\\nwoman\", and enmity between Satan and \"her seed.\"  Now the woman is both\\nEve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. \\n\"Her seed\" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the\\nsame way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as\\nwe do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that\\nMary is also sinless because if she wasn\\'t she would 1) not be at enmity\\nwith the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her\\nsinlessness to Christ\\'s sinlessness would be called into question, as\\nwould God\\'s veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the\\nserpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.\\n    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the\\nArchangle Gabriel \"full of grace.\"  As I pointed out above this is from\\nthe Greek word \"Kecharitomene\" which means not just full of grace, but a\\nplenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by\\nthe footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, \"Hail you who have been and reamin\\nfilled with grace.\"  But that is a little to long to say, so it is\\nreduced to full of grace.  And as it says, \"you who have been\" Mary had\\nalways been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which\\nwas also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.\\n    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done\\nwhat the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if\\nGod could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his\\nMother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the\\nFathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo\\n, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of\\nChristian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on\\nthe matter in \"Ineffibilus Deus.\"\\n\\nAndy Byler\\n',\n",

The founder of this\\nsect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the\\nPromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major\\nreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-\\nduism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of\\nJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised\\nMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all\\nthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger\\nfrom God have been fulfilled.\\n\\n        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and\\nextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-\\ntians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-\\nnessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect\\nis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.\\nDispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many\\nadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who\\ncome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.\\n\\n        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about\\na better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-\\ngions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-\\nerhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi\\nMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-\\ncially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.\\n\\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\\ntablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-\\nics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed\\nby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect\\'s\\ninternal resources.\\n\\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\\nreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\\none universal religion.\\n\\n\\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \\n==================\\n\\n        When the Call For Votes is called,  the  discussion  will\\nofficially  end.   Voting  will be held for about three weeks. If\\nthe group gets 2/3rd majority AND  100  more  \"YES/Create\"  votes\\nthan  \"NO/don\\'t  create\"  votes;  the group shall be created.

Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal\\nimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant \\ninvolved with acupuncture needle insertion. \\n\\nMost acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      \\ndo this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of \\ndiseases via this route...so it\\'s good business to advertise \"disposable needlesused here.\" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, \\nbeing poorly manufactured and too \"sharp\" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        \\nIf I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get \\ntheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      \\nThe risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly \\nuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              \\npatient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates \\nthis risk. Better quality needles tend to \"slide\" past vessels and            \\nnerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        \\nAcupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all \\nsolid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into \\nmeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require \\nthe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \\ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical \"shot.\" when the skin is \\npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \\nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to \"squeeze\" the needle \\nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any \\'cooties\\' that \\nhaven\\'t been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \\non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \\n\\nOf course in TCM...the body\\'s exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \\nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \\nsite.\\n\\n\\nWhile I\\'m fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \\ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \\nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful. \\n\\nJohn Badanes, DC, CA\\nromdas@uclink.berkeley.edu\\n                                                                                                    \\n  \\n',\n",

This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an\\n    example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).\\n\\n    About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received\\n    from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself\\n    became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and\\n    asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.\\n\\n    He wanted to share Our Lord\\'s suffering to\\tshow  his  reciprocal\\n    love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the\\n    finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of\\n    wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.\\n    While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his\\n    younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.\\n    Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well\\n    with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,\\n    intelligent and always had something interesting to say.\\n\\n\\n    Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint\\tIgna-\\n    tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)\\n    towards which Saint Aloysius\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  -12-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the\\n    marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.\\n\\n    After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in\\n    order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even\\n\\n    through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the\\n    religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.\\n\\n    The Marquis\\' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his\\n    son:  \"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-\\n    ness?\" \"I will not, father,\" was the  in-evitable  reply.\\t\"Then\\n    leave from my sight and don\\'t return until you change your mind!\"\\n    With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to\\tpray:\\n    \"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\" He knelt down\\n    to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but\\n    this  time\\the was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This\\n    at last brought the proud man to his senses. \"The Lord wants him,\\n    the Lord can have him.\" He gave his consent for his son to become\\n    a Jesuit.\\n\\n    After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-\\n    ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and\\n    could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-\\n    sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare\\n    the dying for a holy death.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from\\tcarrying  and\\n    nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever\\n    and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul\\tto  the  Lord\\n    while gazing at a crucifix.\\n\\n    Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his\\n    humility, purity and confidence in prayer.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.\\n\\n    - Brendan Arthur\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of\\n    others as a sword is to a soldier\\n\\nGod Bless\\n\\nFrom Simon\\nLines:  106\\n-- \\n/----------------------------------------------------------------|-------\\\\\\n|  Simon P.

The\\nprogram was described by these men as \"ineffective . . . not one person was\\nhealed.\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent\\nfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were\\ndriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \"reparative therapy.\"\\n\\nThe previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June\\n30, 1992 called \"The Ex-Ex-Gay\" by Robert Pela.\\n\\nSome personal thoughts:\\n\\nIt is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major\\nportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among\\nits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even\\nlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and\\nsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.\\nToday\\'s scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is\\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \"physically\" forced\\nto stay in this \"reparative therapy\" but sheer social pressure is enough for\\nmany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.\\n\\nAs an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution\\nagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by\\nthe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,\\nnot by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven\\';t\\na clue what is in their heart.\\n\\nFor those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them\\nplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians\\nAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of\\npeople comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends\\nwho have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to\\na parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some \"first-hand\" real life and\\nloving understanding.

       " \"From: smb@research.att.com (Steven Bellovin)\\nSubject: Clipper -- some new thoughts\\nOrganization: AT&T Bell Laboratories\\nLines: 55\\n\\nI'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments\\nthat went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for\\nsci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since\\nthe traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.\\n\\nI'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my\\nfollowup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\\nfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\\n80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\\nacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\\nrepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\\nwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\\nin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\\nA slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\\nand then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\\nneither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\\nto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\\nthe subkeys even more.\\n\\nOther thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\\nmake sure they stop''.\\n\\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\\nthe warrant.\\n\\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\\nlong.\\n\\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\\nwithout the back door.\\n\\nThe cryptographic protocol, though, is another matter.  I see no valid\\nreasons for keeping it secret, and -- as I hope I've shown above -- there\\nare a lot of ways to do things that aren't (quite) as bad.\\n\",\n",

I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a\\nDRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if the\\ncontroller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.\\n\\nThe only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National\\nSemiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would\\nlike to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to\\nimplement in my circuit.\\n\\nBTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas\\nSemiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer\\nChip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM\\nmemory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the\\npower is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).

Also according \\nto James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a \"dead\" or \\n\"useless\" faith which fails to save.\\n\\nJames 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it\\nis teaching (2).
